  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function takes a value and sanitizes it for storage in the ngModel. However, if the sanitization fails (throws an error), the function returns the old, potentially unsanitized value. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the context of the user's browser."
