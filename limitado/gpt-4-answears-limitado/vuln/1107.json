  "vulnerabilities": ["Denial of Service (DoS)", "Buffer Overflow"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and Buffer Overflow. The 'Content-length' header is directly used to allocate a buffer without any checks, allowing an attacker to cause the server to allocate an arbitrary amount of memory, potentially leading to resource exhaustion and a DoS condition. Additionally, the 'copy' method is used without checking if the chunk size exceeds the buffer size, which can lead to a Buffer Overflow."
