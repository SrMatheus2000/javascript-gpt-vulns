  "description": "The function does not validate the type of the input 'value'. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the function is passed an argument of an unexpected type. Additionally, if the 'value' is an object, the function uses JSON.stringify() to convert it to a string. If the object contains any user-supplied input, this could potentially lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, as the stringified object is not properly sanitized before being returned."
