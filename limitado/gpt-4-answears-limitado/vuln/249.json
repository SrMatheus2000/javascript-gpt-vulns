  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the use of the 'dangerouslySetInnerHTML' property in React, which allows the insertion of HTML directly into the page. If the 'sanitizer' function does not properly sanitize all possible malicious scripts, an attacker could inject malicious scripts into 'source', which would then be executed when the component is rendered. This could lead to various attacks such as stealing sensitive data or performing actions on behalf of the user. Additionally, the function does not properly encode or escape the output, which could lead to injection attacks if the 'source' contains special characters."
