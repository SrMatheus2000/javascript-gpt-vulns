  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)", "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) as it uses user input directly in a regular expression without proper sanitization. This can lead to excessive consumption of CPU resources. Additionally, if the 'escapeInterpolation' option is not set, the function could be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks as it directly inserts user input into the output string without proper escaping or encoding."
