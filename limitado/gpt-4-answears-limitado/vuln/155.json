  "description": "The function '_transformMeasurements' is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM) by appending child elements to the body of the document without properly sanitizing the input. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the SVG tags, which would then be executed when the SVG is rendered in the browser."
