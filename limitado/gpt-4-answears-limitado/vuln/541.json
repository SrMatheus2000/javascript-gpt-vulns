  "description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection because it uses the exec function to execute a curl command with user-supplied input (req.query.url) without proper sanitization or validation. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server. The function is also vulnerable to path traversal because it uses user-supplied input (req.params.slug) to construct file paths without proper sanitization or validation.
