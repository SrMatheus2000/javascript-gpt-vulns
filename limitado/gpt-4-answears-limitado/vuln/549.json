  "description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the input 'ids', 'linkStr', and 'tooltip'. This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the input is rendered directly to the DOM. Also, the function does not escape the output, which could lead to injection attacks if the output is used in a context that is interpreted as code."
