  "description": "The function is vulnerable to uncontrolled recursion which can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) if an attacker provides a specially crafted 'path' argument. This is due to the recursive call to the 'set' function without any termination condition. This vulnerability is classified as CWE-770. Additionally, the function modifies the input object 'obj' which can lead to unexpected behavior if the object is assumed to be immutable. This vulnerability is classified as CWE-471."
