  "isVulnerable": true,

  "vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection because it uses the exec function to execute a shell command that includes user-supplied input (the 'filename' parameter). An attacker could potentially provide a malicious filename that includes shell commands, which would then be executed on the server."
