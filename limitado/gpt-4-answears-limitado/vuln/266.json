  "description": "The function does not validate the input properly. It directly uses the request URL and request body without any sanitization or validation. This can lead to various attacks such as Code Injection, where an attacker can inject malicious code through the request. Also, the function uses the 'new RegExp()' method which can lead to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) if a user is allowed to supply a part of the regular expression."
