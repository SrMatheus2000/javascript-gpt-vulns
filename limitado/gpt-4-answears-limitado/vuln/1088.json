  "description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection because it uses execFile function without proper sanitization of user input. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. It is also vulnerable to path traversal attacks because it uses path.join with user input, which could allow an attacker to access sensitive files. Additionally, the function does not limit the number of redirects, which could lead to a denial of service attack."
