  "vulnerabilities": ["Buffer Overflow"],
  "description": "The function does not perform any checks on the 'length' parameter before using it to create a new Buffer and copy data into it. If a large value is passed for 'length', it could lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution or causing the application to crash."
