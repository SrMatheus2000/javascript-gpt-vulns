  "description": "The function is vulnerable to code injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'name' variable is directly constructed from the query parameters without any sanitization or encoding, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code. This code will be executed when the JSONP response is processed on the client side, leading to potential XSS attacks."
