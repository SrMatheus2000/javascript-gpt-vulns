  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the use of 'document.createElement' and 'appendChild' methods which can be manipulated to inject malicious scripts into the web page. The function does not sanitize or validate the input before using it to create elements, making it possible for an attacker to inject malicious scripts."
