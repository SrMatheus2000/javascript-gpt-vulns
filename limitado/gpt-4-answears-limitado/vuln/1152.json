  "description": "The function is vulnerable to several types of attacks. Firstly, it does not validate or sanitize input before using it to create a WebSocket, which could lead to attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH). Secondly, it does not implement any form of anti-CSRF tokens, making it vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. Lastly, it does not handle errors securely, potentially revealing sensitive information to an attacker."
