  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly inserts user input (`text.title` and `text.content`) into HTML without any sanitization or encoding. An attacker could inject malicious scripts by providing a `text` object with script tags in the `title` or `content` properties. These scripts would then be executed when the generated HTML is rendered in a browser."
