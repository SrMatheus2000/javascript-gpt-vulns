  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Open Redirect attacks because it does not validate the 'dest' variable which is directly derived from the user input '_url.hostname'. An attacker can manipulate the 'dest' variable to redirect the user to a malicious site. The function also exposes sensitive information such as error details to the client, which can be exploited by an attacker to gain more information about the system. Additionally, the function does not limit the number of requests a client can make, making it susceptible to Denial of Service attacks."
