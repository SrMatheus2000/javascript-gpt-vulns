  "vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection because it concatenates a variable (ap.ssid) directly into a command string that is executed by the system. An attacker could potentially control the value of ap.ssid, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the system."
