  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) because it uses user-supplied input in 'request.url' to construct a file path without properly sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to access arbitrary files on the server by sending a specially crafted request. Additionally, the function may expose sensitive information (CWE-200) when an error occurs while reading a file. The error message, which could contain details about the server's file system, is sent back in the response."
