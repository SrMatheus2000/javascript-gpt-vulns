  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Information Exposure through the error message that is printed when the SERVE_USER and SERVE_PASSWORD environment variables are not set. This could potentially provide an attacker with sensitive information. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Path Traversal attacks as it does not properly limit or sanitize the pathname, allowing an attacker to access restricted directories. The function also exposes information by setting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to '*', which allows any domain to access the resources."
