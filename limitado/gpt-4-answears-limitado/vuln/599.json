  "": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input to create HTML content. If the 'html' configuration is set to true, the user input is directly inserted into the page as HTML. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page, which will be executed when the page is loaded."
