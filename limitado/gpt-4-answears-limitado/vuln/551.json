  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function takes user input and directly inserts it into the HTML DOM with the .html() and .innerHTML methods. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, which will be executed when the page is loaded. The function does not properly sanitize the user input before inserting it into the HTML DOM, which is a common cause of XSS vulnerabilities."
