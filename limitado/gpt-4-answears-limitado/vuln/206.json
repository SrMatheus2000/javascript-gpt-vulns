  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution which can lead to several injection vulnerabilities. Although the function checks for '__proto__', it does not check for 'prototype' and 'constructor', which can be used to alter a JavaScript object prototype. The function also does not validate the input objects, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the source object contains functions or other non-primitive values."
