  "vulnerabilities": ["Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)", "Injection Attacks"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks due to the use of regular expressions in the 'mime.match' and '/^application\\/(?:.+\\+)?json$/.test(mime)' statements. An attacker could provide a specially crafted payload that causes the application to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service. Additionally, the function does not validate or sanitize the 'payload' input, which could lead to injection attacks if the payload contains malicious code."
