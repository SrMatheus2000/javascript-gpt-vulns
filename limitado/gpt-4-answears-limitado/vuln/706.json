  "vulnerabilities": ["Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks. This is due to the use of regular expressions in the replace() method. An attacker can provide a specially crafted string that causes the regular expression to take a long time to evaluate, effectively causing a denial of service. This is classified as CWE-20: Improper Input Validation, as the function does not properly validate the input before processing it."
