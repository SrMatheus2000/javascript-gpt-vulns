  "CWEs": ["CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection"],
  "description": "The function $.render is vulnerable to code injection. It uses the new Function() constructor to create a new function from a string, which is built using the template parameter. If an attacker can control the template parameter, they can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including cross-site scripting (XSS), data theft, and other malicious activities."
