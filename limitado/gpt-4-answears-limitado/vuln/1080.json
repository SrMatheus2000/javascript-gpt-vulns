  "description": "The function does not sanitize or escape the 'value' parameter in the 'wrapValue' and '_wrapString' methods. This could lead to SQL Injection if the 'value' parameter can be controlled by an attacker. An attacker could provide a 'value' that modifies the SQL query to change its intent, leading to unauthorized access or modification of data."
