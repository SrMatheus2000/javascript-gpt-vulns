  "description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the 'params' input, which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the input is controlled by an attacker. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that can steal sensitive information or perform actions on behalf of the user. Additionally, the function does not control the type of 'params' input, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the input is not of the expected type."
