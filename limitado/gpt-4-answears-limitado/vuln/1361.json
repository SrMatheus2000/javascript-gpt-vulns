  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) because it uses user input to construct a file path without properly sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to access arbitrary files on the server. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79) because it directly uses user input to set the 'content-type' header without proper sanitization, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts."
