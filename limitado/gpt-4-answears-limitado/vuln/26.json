  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to the use of regular expressions with potentially exponential worst-case complexity. This could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service by providing a specially crafted input that takes a long time to process. Additionally, the use of the 'decodeURIComponent' function without proper sanitization could lead to potential code injection attacks, as it can decode special characters that could be interpreted as code."
