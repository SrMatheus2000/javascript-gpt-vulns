  "description": "The function `findIndexes` is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks. This is because it uses a regular expression (`new RegExp("\\b(?:" + identifiers.join("|") + ")\\b", "g")`) that can cause catastrophic backtracking when given a specially crafted input, leading to excessive CPU usage. Additionally, the function does not validate the `identifiers` input, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the input is not an array or contains non-string elements."
