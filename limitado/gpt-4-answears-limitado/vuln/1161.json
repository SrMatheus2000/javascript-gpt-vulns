  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input in file paths without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete files outside of the intended directory. It is also vulnerable to OS Command Injection (CWE-78) and Code Injection (CWE-94) as it uses user-supplied input in git commands without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands or code."
