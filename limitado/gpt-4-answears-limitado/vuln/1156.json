  "description": "The function is vulnerable as it does not validate or sanitize the 'msg' input before parsing it with JSON.parse, which can lead to various types of Injection attacks. For example, an attacker can inject malicious code or scripts (Code Injection, CWE-94), SQL commands (SQL Injection, CWE-89), or HTML/JavaScript (Cross-site Scripting, CWE-79). This is due to Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)."
