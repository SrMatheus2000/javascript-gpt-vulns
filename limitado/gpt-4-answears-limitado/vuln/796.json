  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) because it uses user input from 'req.url' to access files on the server without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server by sending a specially crafted request. The function is also vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) because it reads the entire file into memory with 'fs.readFileSync(targetPath)' before sending it to the client. This could lead to a denial of service if an attacker requests a very large file."
