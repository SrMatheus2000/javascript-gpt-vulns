  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function does not properly sanitize the 'text' input, which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This occurs when the 'tag' is included in the 'nonTextTagsArray', as the 'text' is directly appended to the 'result' without any sanitization. An attacker can inject malicious scripts as 'text', which will be executed when 'result' is rendered in the browser."
