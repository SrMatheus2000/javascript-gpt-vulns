  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct a file path without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access, read, or write to arbitrary files on the server. It's also vulnerable to SQL Injection (CWE-89) as it uses user input directly in a database query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the query to retrieve, modify, or delete arbitrary data. Lastly, it's vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79) as it uses user input in a response without proper sanitization or encoding. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that
