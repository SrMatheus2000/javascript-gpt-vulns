  "description": "The function createMuteOgg is vulnerable to command injection. It constructs a command string using user-supplied input (options.sampleRate, options.seconds, options.numOfChannels, and outputFile), and then passes this string to child_process_1.exec, which executes the command. An attacker could provide specially crafted input to execute arbitrary commands on the system."
