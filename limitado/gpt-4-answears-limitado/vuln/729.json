  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Insecure Buffer Allocation"],
  "description": "The function uses 'Buffer.allocUnsafe' and 'new Buffer' to allocate buffer memory. These methods can lead to security vulnerabilities as they allocate memory and do not initialize it, the data that was previously in the memory can be leaked. It's recommended to use 'Buffer.alloc' instead, which ensures that the newly created Buffer is zero-filled."
