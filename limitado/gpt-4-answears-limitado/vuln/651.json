  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. The regular expression used in the function can cause exponential time complexity on the inputs with nested quantifiers. An attacker can provide a malicious input which can make the application unresponsive. Also, there is no validation on the 'identifiers' input. An attacker can pass any value which can lead to unexpected behavior of the function."
