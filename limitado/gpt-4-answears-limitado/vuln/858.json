  "CWEs": ["CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection"],
  "description": "The function parseAssignment() is vulnerable to code injection attacks. This is because it directly uses the input provided by the user (name, args, value) to create new nodes (AssignmentNode, FunctionAssignmentNode). An attacker can manipulate these inputs to inject malicious code, which will then be executed by the application. This can lead to serious security issues such as data theft, data corruption, and denial of service."
