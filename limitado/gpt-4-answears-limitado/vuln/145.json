  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319) and Information Exposure (CWE-200). The function sends HTTP requests and includes support for HTTP Basic Authentication. However, it does not enforce the use of HTTPS for secure communication. This means that if the function is used to send sensitive information such as usernames and passwords over an insecure HTTP connection, that information could be exposed to eavesdroppers. Additionally, the function exposes potentially sensitive information in error messages, which could aid an attacker in exploiting other vulnerabilities."
