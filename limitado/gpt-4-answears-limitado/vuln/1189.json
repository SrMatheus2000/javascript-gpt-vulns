  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'nodeName' variable is constructed by concatenating user-controlled input ('currNodeData.name') without proper sanitization or encoding, and then it is used to set the 'text' property of a dialog window. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts as the 'name' property of the 'currNodeData' object, which would then be executed in the context of the user's browser when the dialog window is displayed."
