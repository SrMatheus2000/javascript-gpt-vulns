  "description": "The function uses a regular expression to validate email addresses. However, the regular expression is not specific enough and can lead to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) if a long string of characters is passed as an argument. An attacker can exploit this by providing a long, specially crafted string as an email address, causing the application to consume excessive resources and potentially crash."
