  "description": "The provided JavaScript function does not appear to have any obvious vulnerabilities. It checks the type of connection and sets the interval and timeout values accordingly. If there is an error in the response, it advises a handshake reconnect. Otherwise, it advises a retry reconnect with the previously set interval and timeout. There are no direct user inputs being processed, no insecure API calls, and no insecure data handling that could lead to common vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, or Command Injection."
