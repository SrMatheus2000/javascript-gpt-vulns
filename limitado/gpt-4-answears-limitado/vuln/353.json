  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly injects user-controlled data (the 'markup' parameter) into HTML without proper sanitization or output encoding. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through this parameter, which would then be executed in the context of the user's browser when the generated HTML is rendered. This could lead to various harmful actions, such as stealing sensitive data or performing actions on behalf of the user. The vulnerability corresponds to CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')."
