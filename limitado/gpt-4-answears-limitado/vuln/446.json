  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly inserts user-controlled data (`enc` and `value`) into HTML output without proper sanitization or encoding. An attacker could inject malicious scripts by providing specially crafted input, which would then be executed in the browser of any user viewing the resulting page."
