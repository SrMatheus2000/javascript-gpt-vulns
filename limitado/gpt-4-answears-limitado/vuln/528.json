  "": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses the 'content' variable to set the HTML of the 'code' element without properly sanitizing it first. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through the 'content' variable, which would then be executed when the HTML is rendered in the browser."
