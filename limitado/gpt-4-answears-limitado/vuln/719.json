  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct a file path without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to access, read, or write files outside of the intended directory. It is also vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79) as it directly uses user input in the response without proper encoding or escaping, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts. Additionally, it is vulnerable to SQL Injection (CWE-89) as it uses user input directly in a database query without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate the query."
