  "vulnerabilities": ["Improper Input Validation", "SQL Injection", "OS Command Injection"],
  "description": "The function printDirect is vulnerable due to the lack of input validation. The parameters passed to the function are not validated or sanitized, which can lead to various types of attacks. For instance, if the 'printer' parameter is controlled by an attacker, it can lead to SQL Injection (CWE-89) or OS Command Injection (CWE-78) vulnerabilities. The function also lacks error handling mechanism which can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. The 'TODO' comments in the code indicate that the developer is aware of the need for parameter type checking, but it has not been implemented yet."
