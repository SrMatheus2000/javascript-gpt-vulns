  "description "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input to create HTML content. Specifically, the 'item.text' and 'item.title' properties are directly inserted into the HTML without any sanitization or encoding. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through these properties, which would then be executed when the HTML is rendered in a user's browser."
