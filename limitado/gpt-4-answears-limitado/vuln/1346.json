  "description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection. The 'dir' parameter is directly concatenated into the command string without any sanitization or escaping. This means that if a user can control the 'dir' parameter, they can inject arbitrary commands to be executed on the server. For example, if a user sets 'dir' to '; rm -rf /', the server would execute a command that deletes all files on the server."
