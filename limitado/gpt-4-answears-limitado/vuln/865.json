  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to code injection. In the 'FunctionExpression' block, it creates a new Function using user-controlled inputs (keys and unparse(node)). An attacker can control the 'vars' and 'ast' parameters to inject malicious code, which will be executed when the function is invoked. This can lead to serious security issues such as data theft, data manipulation, or remote code execution."
