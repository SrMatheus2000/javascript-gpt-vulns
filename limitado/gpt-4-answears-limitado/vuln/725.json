  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Buffer Overflow"],
  "description": "The function uses the 'new Buffer()' constructor, which can lead to security vulnerabilities if not properly controlled. The 'new Buffer()' constructor is deprecated due to security and usability issues. It can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if the input is a number. It's recommended to use 'Buffer.from()', 'Buffer.alloc()', or 'Buffer.allocUnsafe()' instead."
