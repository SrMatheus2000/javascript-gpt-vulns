  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["SQL Injection"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks. This is due to the fact that it constructs SQL queries by concatenating user-controlled input without properly sanitizing or escaping it. An attacker could potentially manipulate the SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code, leading to unauthorized access, data corruption or data leakage."
