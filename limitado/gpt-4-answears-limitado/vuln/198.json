  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it reads files directly from the filesystem without validating the input filename, which could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files. It also exposes sensitive information (CWE-200) by revealing internal configuration details. Additionally, it exposes detailed error messages (CWE-209) that could provide an attacker with useful information. Finally, it does not limit the size of the file being read into memory (CWE-400), which could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if an attacker can cause it to read a large file."
