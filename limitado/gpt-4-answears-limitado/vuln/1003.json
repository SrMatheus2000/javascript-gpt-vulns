  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The title option is directly inserted into the HTML without any sanitization or escaping, which means if an attacker can control the value of this.options.title, they can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code. This code will be executed when the page is loaded, potentially leading to a variety of attacks such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
