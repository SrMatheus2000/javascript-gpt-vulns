  "description": "The provided JavaScript function does not appear to have any obvious vulnerabilities. It is simply iterating over a nodeList and pushing values into an array. There are no obvious security issues such as injection vulnerabilities, insecure use of eval, or insecure direct object references. However, without knowing the context in which this function is used and the nature of the data it processes, it is impossible to definitively say that it is completely secure."
