  "description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the 'options' object that it receives as a parameter. This can lead to several vulnerabilities. For instance, if 'options' contains a 'socketIOClientCallback' property that is not a function, it is simply deleted and the function continues to execute, which could lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function does not validate or sanitize the 'url' property of 'incomingSailsIOMsg', which could lead to SQL Injection if the URL contains malicious SQL commands.
