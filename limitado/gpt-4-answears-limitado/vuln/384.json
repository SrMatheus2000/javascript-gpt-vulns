  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'url', 'width', and 'height' parameters are directly inserted into the HTML without any sanitization or encoding, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts. This is a common vulnerability known as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), specifically a Stored XSS attack. The attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session. This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing the victim's session cookies or performing actions on their behalf."
