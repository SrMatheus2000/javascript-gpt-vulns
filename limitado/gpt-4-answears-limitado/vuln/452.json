  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection"],
  "description": "The function appears to be vulnerable to code injection. The 'func' variable is directly invoked with user-controlled input ('strings' and 'expressions'), which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. This is a serious security risk, as it could lead to a complete system compromise."
