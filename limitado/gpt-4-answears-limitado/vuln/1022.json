  "vulnerabilities": ["Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)", "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) because it uses user input directly in a regular expression without any sanitization. This can lead to a denial of service if an attacker provides a malicious input that results in excessive backtracking. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it does not properly escape or encode the output. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts."
