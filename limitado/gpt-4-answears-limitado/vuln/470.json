  "description": "The function scanWifi is vulnerable to command injection. This is because it concatenates a user-supplied string (config.iface) directly into a command string (commandStr) that is later passed to exec(), which executes the command in a shell. An attacker could provide a specially crafted string that includes shell commands, which would then be executed on the server."
