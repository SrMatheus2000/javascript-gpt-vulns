  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function directly inserts user-controlled data (repo.username and repo.reponame) into HTML content. If an attacker can control these values, they can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code, which will be executed in the context of the victim's session. This can lead to session theft, account takeover, or other malicious actions."
