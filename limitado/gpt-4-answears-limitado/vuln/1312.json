  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'innerHTML' property is used to insert user-controlled data (firstLine) into the HTML document, which is sanitized by the 'sanitizeHtmlCode' function.

This is classified as CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')."
