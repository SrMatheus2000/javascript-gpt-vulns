  "description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the input 'string' and 'opts' which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the input is controlled by an attacker. Also, the function does not properly escape or encode the output which can lead to Code Injection if the output is used in a context that allows for code execution."
