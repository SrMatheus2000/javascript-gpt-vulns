  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["JSON Injection", "Denial of Service"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to JSON Injection because it uses JSON.parse() on user-supplied data without proper validation. This can lead to various attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Denial of Service (DoS). Additionally, the function does not limit the size of the parsed JSON, which can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by consuming server resources."
