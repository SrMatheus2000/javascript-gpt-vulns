  "description": "The function 'requireModule' is vulnerable as it allows for the dynamic loading of modules based on a user-supplied path. This can lead to several vulnerabilities. Firstly, it can lead to code injection (CWE-94) if an attacker is able to control the 'path' parameter and load malicious modules. Secondly, it can lead to a denial of service (CWE-400) if an attacker is able to cause the application to continuously load modules, consuming system resources. Lastly, it can lead to path traversal (
