  "description": "The function getAnnotationURL(sourceMapString) is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks. This is because it uses a regular expression to parse the input string, and if the input string is large or complex enough, it can cause the application to hang or crash. This is a type of denial of service attack. The function also does not validate the input string before using it, which is a violation of CWE-20: Improper Input Validation."
