  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the use of innerHTML property at line 'item.innerHTML = match( string, option );'. The innerHTML property sets or returns the HTML content (inner HTML) of an element. If this property is used to insert user-controlled input, it could lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack, which allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users."
