  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability exists because the function uses the 'innerHTML' property to add user-supplied input ('alt' attribute of an image) to the 'title' element. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious scripts as the 'alt' attribute of an image, which will be executed when the 'title' element is rendered in the browser."
