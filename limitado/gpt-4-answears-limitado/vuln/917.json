  "description": "The function _showHeader is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input (repo.username, repo.reponame, repo.branch) in the HTML content without proper sanitization or encoding. An attacker could inject malicious scripts by manipulating these inputs, leading to potential security risks such as stealing sensitive data or performing actions on behalf of the user."
