  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) as it does not implement any CSRF protection mechanism. It is also vulnerable to Information Exposure as it logs sensitive information such as access tokens when loggingNoPII option is false. Additionally, the function does not limit the size of the access token that can be processed, making it vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption attacks."
