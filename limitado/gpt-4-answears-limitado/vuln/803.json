  "vulnerabilities": ["Injection vulnerability", "Lack of input validation"],
  "description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the input 'form' which can lead to injection attacks. For instance, if an attacker can control the input 'form', they can inject malicious code or commands. Additionally, the function does not handle errors properly. When an error occurs, it simply throws an error message without any further handling. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or application crashes."
