  "": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'location.href' is used in the function to create a URL for the 'marker-start' and 'marker-end' attributes in the SVG element. If an attacker can control the 'location.href', they can inject malicious scripts into the SVG element, which will be executed when the SVG is rendered."
