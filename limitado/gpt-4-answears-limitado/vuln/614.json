  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the use of 'innerHTML' property which allows the execution of malicious scripts if the 'string' or 'option' variables are controlled by an attacker. An attacker can inject malicious scripts into 'string' or 'option' variables that will be executed when the function is called."
