  "description": "The function is using 'ipcRenderer.sendSync' which is a synchronous inter-process communication (IPC) method. This can be exploited by an attacker to send arbitrary events from a renderer process to the main process, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if unsanitized input is passed. It's recommended to use context isolation and validate or sanitize all inputs."
