  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function takes an input 'd' and uses it to create HTML tags without properly sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, which would then be executed in the context of the victim's browser. The vulnerability is particularly concerning in the 'extraStyle' variable, where the input is directly included in the style attribute of an HTML tag."
