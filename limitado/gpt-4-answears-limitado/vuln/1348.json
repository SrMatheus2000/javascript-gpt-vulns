  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The Path Traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) is due to the use of '__dirname + '/cache'' in the 'fs.readFile' function, which could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system by manipulating the path. The Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability (CWE-918) is due to the use of 'http.get' function with a URL that could be manipulated by an attacker to make the server send a request to an arbitrary URL."
