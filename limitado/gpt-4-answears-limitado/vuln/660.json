  "description": "The function is vulnerable to both Code Injection and Path Traversal attacks. The 'require' function is used with a variable 'name' which is directly concatenated without any sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to potentially load and execute arbitrary code (Code Injection) or access files outside of the intended directory (Path Traversal)."
