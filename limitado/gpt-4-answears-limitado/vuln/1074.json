  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input to create HTML tags and attributes without properly sanitizing the input. An attacker could inject malicious scripts through the 'rows' or 'opts.tag' parameters, which would then be executed in the user's browser when the generated HTML is rendered."
