  "description": "The function createMenuItems is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses the 'innerHTML' property to add HTML content to the button element. If the 'item.text' or 'item.submenuTitle' values are user-controlled and not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious scripts, leading to XSS attacks. It's recommended to use 'textContent' instead of 'innerHTML' when setting the text of an element, or ensure proper sanitization of user inputs."
