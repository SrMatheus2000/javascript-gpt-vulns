  "description": "The function 'wrapValue' is vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks. It directly concatenates the 'value' parameter into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. An attacker could provide a 'value' that alters the SQL query to perform unintended actions, such as retrieving, altering, or deleting data."
