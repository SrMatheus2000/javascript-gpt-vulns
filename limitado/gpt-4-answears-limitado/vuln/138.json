  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Prototype Pollution"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. The function does not validate the input for the 'path' parameter. If the path is '__proto__[prop]' or 'constructor.prototype[prop]', it can add or modify properties of the Object prototype. This can lead to various application-level vulnerabilities like Denial of Service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), or even lead to other vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)."
