  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input to create HTML content (in the 'html' property and 'addElement' method), without properly sanitizing the input. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through the 'elementName', 'label', or 'newElementIdPrefix' options, which would then be executed when the generated HTML is rendered in a web page."
