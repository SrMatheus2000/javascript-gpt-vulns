  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Unvalidated input", "Potential null pointer dereference"],
  "description": "The function does not validate the 'files' input, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input is not an array or does not contain the expected properties. This is an example of CWE-20: Improper Input Validation. Additionally, the function does not check if 'file.parent' is null before calling 'split' on it, which could lead to a null pointer dereference (CWE-476)."
