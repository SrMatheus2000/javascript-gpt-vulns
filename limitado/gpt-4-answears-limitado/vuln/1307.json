  "description": "The function is vulnerable to code injection through the yaml.load() function, which can execute arbitrary code if it's passed a malicious YAML document. This can lead to remote code execution. The function is also vulnerable to path traversal attacks, as it uses user input to construct file paths without proper sanitization. This can allow an attacker to access, read, or write files outside of the intended directory. Additionally, the function does not limit the size of the data it processes, which can lead to denial of service if an attacker sends a
