  "vulnerabilities": ["SQL Injection", "Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function handleSource is vulnerable to SQL Injection because it directly uses the user input (req.body.subscribed_url) in the postlookup function without any sanitization or parameterized query. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the SQL query. Also, there is no input validation for the user-provided data, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors."
