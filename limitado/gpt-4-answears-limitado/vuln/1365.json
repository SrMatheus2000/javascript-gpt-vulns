  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it writes files to a path that could be manipulated by the 'version' parameter. It's also vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (CWE-94) as it downloads and executes a file from a remote server without any validation. Lastly, it's vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) as it does not limit the size of the file being downloaded, which could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack."
