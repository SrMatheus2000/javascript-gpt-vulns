  "description": "The function 'makeDestination' is vulnerable to path traversal attacks. The function uses user-supplied input to build a file path to be created without properly validating or sanitizing the input. An attacker can manipulate the 'to' variable to navigate the file system outside of the intended directory. This can lead to unauthorized access to files or directories, information disclosure, denial of service, or code execution."
