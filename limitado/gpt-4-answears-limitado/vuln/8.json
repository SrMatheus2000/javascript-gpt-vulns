  "description": "The function does not properly validate the input 'value' before using it. This can lead to type coercion vulnerabilities, where an attacker can provide a 'value' that is not of the expected type, but is still processed by the function. For example, if 'value' is expected to be a string but an object is provided, the function will attempt to split the object, leading to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function uses the 'value' input directly in a JSON.parse call, which can lead to injection attacks if the 'value' is not properly sanitized before use."
