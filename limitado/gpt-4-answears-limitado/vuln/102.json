  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-200: Information Exposure", "CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Insecure handling of user credentials", "Potential exposure of sensitive information"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable as it does not validate the input string before processing it. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Additionally, the function is handling user credentials (username and password) insecurely by directly decoding them from the input string and storing them in the 'parts' object. This could potentially expose sensitive information if the 'parts' object is mishandled or leaked. Furthermore, the function does not encrypt or hash the password, which is a privacy violation."
