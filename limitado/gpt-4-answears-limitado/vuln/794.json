  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input (req.url) to access file system (fs.lstatSync) without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server. It also exposes error details to the client (res.end(error.toString())) which could lead to Information Exposure Through an Error Message (CWE-209) and Information Exposure (CWE-200), providing attackers with potentially sensitive system details."
