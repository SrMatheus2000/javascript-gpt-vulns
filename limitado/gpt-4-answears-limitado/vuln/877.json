  "CWEs": ["CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that it directly uses user-provided data in the 'url' and 'frameName' variables without proper sanitization or encoding. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through these variables, which would then be executed in the context of the user's session. This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as session hijacking, identity theft, or defacement of the website."
