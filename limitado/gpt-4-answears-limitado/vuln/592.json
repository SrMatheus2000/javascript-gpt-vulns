  "description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection because it concatenates the 'processName' directly into the 'apiRoute' without any sanitization or parameterization. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the SQL query. Also, the function does not validate the 'processName' input, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors."
