  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Information Disclosure and Denial of Service attacks. In the case of an error, the function logs the error message to the console (CWE-209). This could potentially expose sensitive information. Additionally, the function does not limit the size of the request body (CWE-400). This could lead to a Denial of Service attack if an attacker sends a large amount of data in the request body, consuming server resources."
