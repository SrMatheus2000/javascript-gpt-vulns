  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. It directly inserts user-controlled data (`file.name` and `file.path`) into HTML output without proper sanitization or encoding. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts by manipulating the `file.name` or `file.path` values, leading to various types of attacks such as stealing sensitive data, session hijacking, or defacement of the website."
