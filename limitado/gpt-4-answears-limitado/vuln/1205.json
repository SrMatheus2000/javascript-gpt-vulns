  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function uses the .html() method to insert content into the #rep element. If an attacker can control the content of the #db_select or #db_type elements, they could inject malicious scripts that would be executed when the .html() method is called. This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
