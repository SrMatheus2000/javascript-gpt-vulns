  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to code injection attacks. The function interpolates user-controlled input into code that is then executed. This is done in the line 'res = this.interpolator.interpolate(res, data, options.lng || this.language, options);'. If an attacker can control the 'res' or 'data' variables, they can inject malicious code that will be executed. This can lead to serious security issues such as remote code execution."
