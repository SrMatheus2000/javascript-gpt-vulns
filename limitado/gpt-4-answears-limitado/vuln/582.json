  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)", "CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Prototype Pollution"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution which allows an attacker to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. This can lead to several types of attacks like denial of service, property override, or potentially remote code execution if a property is overwritten with a function. The vulnerability occurs because the function does not properly validate the input 'options' and directly assigns its properties to the target object. If an attacker can control the input 'options', they can modify the prototype of Object which is reflected in all objects."
