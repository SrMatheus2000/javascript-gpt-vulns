  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "Improper Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it uses user input in the 'state' parameter directly without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts. It's also vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) because it does not validate or verify the request origin, allowing an attacker to trick a user into executing unwanted actions. Additionally, the function does not properly validate the input in the 'callback' parameter, which could lead to other potential vulnerabilities."
