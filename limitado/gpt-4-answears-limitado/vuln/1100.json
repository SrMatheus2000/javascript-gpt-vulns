  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct a file path without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete files outside of the intended directory. It is also vulnerable to OS Command Injection (CWE-73) as it uses user input in a command that is executed by the system. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. Lastly, the function downloads a file from a URL without checking its integrity (CWE-494), which could lead to the execution of malicious code if the file is tampered with."
