  "description": "The function is vulnerable to several types of attacks. First, it does not validate or sanitize the 'pathBundleIN' and 'pathOUT' inputs, which can lead to Path Traversal (CWE-22) if an attacker provides a malicious path. Second, it uses a hard-coded password (CWE-259), which is a bad security practice as it can be easily discovered and exploited. Lastly, the function uses the 'openssl.spawnWrapper' function with user-supplied input, which can lead to OS Command Injection (CWE-78) if an attacker provides a malicious command."
