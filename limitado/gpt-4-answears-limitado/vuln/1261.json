  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. The function does not validate the input parameters which can be manipulated to modify a JavaScript object prototype. When that happens, properties that are meant to be present only in specific objects become available in all objects, leading to potential data leakage or unexpected behavior."
