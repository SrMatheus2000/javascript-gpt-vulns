  "description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks because it does not properly sanitize the 'socketIOData' input before using it to build the 'req' object. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL commands or scripts. Additionally, the function does not validate the 'socketIOData' input, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors."
