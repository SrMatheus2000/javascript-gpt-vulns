  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the use of innerHTML property in the function. The innerHTML property sets or returns the HTML content (inner HTML) of an element. If the HTML content is not properly sanitized before being assigned to the innerHTML property, it can lead to XSS attacks. In this function, the variable 'html' is directly assigned to innerHTML without any sanitization. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through 'html' which will be executed when the page is loaded."
