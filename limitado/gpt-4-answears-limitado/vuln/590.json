  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["No input validation for 'limit' parameter", "Potential SQL Injection", "Potential Denial of Service (DoS)"],
  "description": "The function does not validate the 'limit' parameter properly. An attacker could provide a very large number, causing the server to consume excessive resources while processing the 'slice' operation, leading to a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Additionally, if the 'logHandler.logs' is somehow linked to a database, there could be a potential SQL Injection vulnerability."
