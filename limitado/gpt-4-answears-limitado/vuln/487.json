  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses the 'group.id', 'group.label', and 'entry.id' in the DOM without properly sanitizing them. If these variables contain malicious scripts, they will be executed when the DOM is rendered. This can lead to various security issues such as session hijacking, identity theft, defacement of the website, etc."
