  "description": "The setText function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks because it directly assigns the 'value' or 'state[property].value' to 'elem.innerHTML'. If the 'value' or 'state[property].value' contains malicious scripts, they will be executed when the HTML is rendered. Similarly, the setList function also assigns an empty string to 'elem.innerHTML', which can also lead to XSS attacks if the string contains malicious scripts."
