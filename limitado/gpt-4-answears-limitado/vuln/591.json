  "description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection because it concatenates a user-controlled variable 'this.processName' directly into the API route. An attacker could manipulate 'this.processName' to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Additionally, the function does not properly validate the 'limit' parameter from the request query, which could lead to unexpected behavior."
