  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-346: Origin Validation Error"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Unvalidated input", "Improper origin validation"],
  "description": "The function getOriginOfRequest does not validate the origin and referrer headers from the request. This can lead to security vulnerabilities as an attacker can manipulate these headers. The function also does not validate the parsed protocol and host from the referrer, which can lead to origin validation errors. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to perform attacks such as Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) or bypassing Same-Origin Policy."
