  "description": "The function does not validate the 'options' parameter, which can lead to potential security issues. The 'prefix' variable is directly used in the 'of' method of the 'Socket' object without any sanitization or validation, which can lead to potential path traversal or remote code execution vulnerabilities if an attacker can control the 'prefix' value. Additionally, the function uses the 'bind' method, which can potentially lead to remote code execution if an attacker can control the 'options' parameter."
