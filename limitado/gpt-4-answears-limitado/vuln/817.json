  "description": "The function uses Math.random() to generate random numbers, which is not cryptographically secure and can lead to predictable randomness (CWE-330). Also, the function does not have any mechanism to prevent excessive resource consumption when processing large inputs, which can lead to a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack (CWE-400)."
