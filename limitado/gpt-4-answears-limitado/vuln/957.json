  "description": "The function is vulnerable as it does not validate or sanitize the 'cookies' input, which can lead to attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). It also stores sensitive information (auth credentials) in clear text, which can be exposed if an attacker gains access to the system. Additionally, the function does not handle session management securely, which can lead to session fixation attacks."
