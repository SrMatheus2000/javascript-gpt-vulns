  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'name' parameter is directly used to set the 'title' and 'href' attributes of the 'link' object, and also used in setting an attribute of the 'current' object. If an attacker can control the value of 'name', they could inject malicious scripts that would be executed when the link is clicked or the attribute is accessed. This could lead to various attacks such as stealing sensitive information, performing actions on behalf of the user, etc."
