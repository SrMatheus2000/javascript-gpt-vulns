  "vulnerabilities": ["Path Traversal", "Information Disclosure"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal attacks as it uses user-supplied input in file paths without proper sanitization or validation. This could allow an attacker to access, read, or modify files outside of the intended directory. Additionally, the function may disclose sensitive information through error messages, which could be exploited by an attacker to gain more information about the system or application."
