  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function uses the innerHTML property to directly write user-controlled input to the webpage. If the user input is not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of the victim's session. This can lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, identity theft, defacement of the website, and other malicious activities."
