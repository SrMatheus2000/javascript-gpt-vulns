  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Prototype Pollution"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to modify the prototype of a JavaScript object, which can lead to an alteration in the behaviour of the object. This can lead to serious security issues like Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or even lead to other vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). In this function, the vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not validate or has improper validation of array indices, which can lead to modification of the built-in JavaScript object prototype."
