  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal attacks as it does not properly sanitize the input for the file path. This could allow an attacker to access sensitive files outside of the intended directory. Additionally, the function does not limit the size of the data it processes, making it susceptible to Denial of Service attacks. The function also exposes potentially sensitive information through error messages, which could be exploited by an attacker."
