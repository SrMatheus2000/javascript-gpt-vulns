  "vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection", "Path Traversal"],
  "description": "The function tileRec is vulnerable to OS command injection because it uses execSync to execute a command that includes user-supplied input (inPath, tempDir, quality). An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to path traversal attacks because it uses user-supplied input to construct file paths without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially read or write files outside of the intended directories."
