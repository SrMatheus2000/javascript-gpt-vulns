  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution which is a type of attack where the properties of JavaScript objects can be manipulated. This can lead to a variety of security vulnerabilities, such as Denial of Service, Remote Code Execution, or even property injection. The function does not validate or sanitize the 'key' input which can be manipulated to overwrite or inject properties. For example, an attacker can pass '__proto__.toString' as a key and overwrite the toString method of all objects."
