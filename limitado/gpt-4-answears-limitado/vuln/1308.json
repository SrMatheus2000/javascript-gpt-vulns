  "description": "The function is vulnerable to code injection via the yaml.load() function, which can execute arbitrary JavaScript code if it's included in the input data. This can lead to serious security issues such as data leakage, data corruption, or even server takeover. The function also does not limit the size of the data it receives, which can lead to a denial of service attack if an attacker sends a large amount of data. Additionally, the function uses user input to construct file paths without proper sanitization, which can lead to path traversal attacks,
