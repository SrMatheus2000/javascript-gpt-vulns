  "": "The function appears to be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that it directly uses user-supplied input in the '_getPasteContent' function without properly sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the context of the victim's session."
