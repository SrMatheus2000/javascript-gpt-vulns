  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks. This is due to the use of regular expressions (regex) in the function. If an attacker provides a specially crafted string as the 'userAgent' parameter, it can cause the regex to take a very long time to evaluate, effectively causing a denial of service. This is known as a ReDoS attack. The function does attempt to mitigate this by checking if the userAgent length is less than a 'MAX_REASONABLE_LENGTH', but if this value is not properly set, the mitigation could be ineffective."
