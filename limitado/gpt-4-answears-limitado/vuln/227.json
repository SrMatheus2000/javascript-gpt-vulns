  "description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the input it receives. This can lead to SQL Injection if the input is used in a SQL query. It can also lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) if the input is rendered on a web page. The function also does not check if the 'domains' parameter is an array before calling the 'split' method on it, which can lead to a TypeError if 'domains' is not a string."
