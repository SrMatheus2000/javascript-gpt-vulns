  "description": "The function uses SHA-1, which is considered weak due to vulnerabilities that allow for collision attacks. It also does not use a salt when hashing the password, making it vulnerable to rainbow table attacks. The scramble value is also used in a predictable manner, which could potentially be exploited. The use of the Buffer constructor is also deprecated due to security and usability issues, and should be replaced with Buffer.from(), Buffer.alloc(), or Buffer.allocUnsafe()."
