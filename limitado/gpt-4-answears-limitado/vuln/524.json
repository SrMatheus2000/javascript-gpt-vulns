  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution which is a type of attack where the properties of JavaScript objects can be manipulated. This can lead to a variety of security vulnerabilities, such as Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, or even Cross-Site Scripting. The vulnerability occurs because the function does not validate or has improper validation of array indices for the 'target' and 'args' parameters, which can lead to adding or modifying properties of 'Object.prototype'."
