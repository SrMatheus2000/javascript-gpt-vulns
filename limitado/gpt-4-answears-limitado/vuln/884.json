  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Buffer Overflow"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. The 'buffer.copy' method is used without proper validation of the input buffer's length. If a buffer with a length greater than the 'mergeBuffer' length is passed, it can lead to memory corruption or other unexpected behavior. The 'options.bufferSize' is also not defined in the function, which could lead to potential issues."
