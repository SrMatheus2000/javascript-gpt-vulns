  "description": "The function is vulnerable to several types of attacks. Firstly, the function does not properly validate the input from the user, which can lead to unexpected behavior (CWE-20). Secondly, the function uses user input to construct a SQL query, which can lead to SQL Injection if the input is not properly sanitized (CWE-89). Lastly, the function does not properly sanitize user input before using it to generate HTML, which can lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks (CWE-79)."
