  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "Attribute Injection"],
  "description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the 'name' and 'value' parameters, which are used to set an attribute on an element. This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the function is used to handle user input, as an attacker could inject malicious scripts. Additionally, the function does not escape the 'name' parameter when it is used as an attribute name, which could lead to Attribute Injection if the function is used with untrusted data."
