  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "Improper Input Validation", "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it directly injects the response body into the HTML without sanitizing it first. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts. It also lacks proper input validation, which could lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) because it does not verify if the request was intentionally made by the user."
