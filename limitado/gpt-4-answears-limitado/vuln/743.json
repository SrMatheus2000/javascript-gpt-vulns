  "vulnerabilities": ["Timing Attack"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to timing attacks. The time taken by the function to compare two strings can be used by an attacker to guess the string values. This is because the function uses the 'crypto.timingSafeEqual' method, which is not constant time if the lengths of the input buffers are controlled by an attacker. The function also does not validate the input types, which can lead to unexpected behavior."
