  "isVulnerable": true,

  "vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection"],
  "description": "The function appears to be vulnerable to code injection. It dynamically executes code based on user input (scope, locals) without proper sanitization or validation. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code and execute it in the context of the application. The 'ensureSafeObject' and 'ensureSafeFunction' methods suggest some level of security control, but without seeing their implementation, it's impossible to determine their effectiveness."
