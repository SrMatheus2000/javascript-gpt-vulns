  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'html' parameter is directly used to set the 'innerHTML' property of a 'div' element. This means that if an attacker can control the value of 'html', they can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code, which will be executed when the page is rendered. This can lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
