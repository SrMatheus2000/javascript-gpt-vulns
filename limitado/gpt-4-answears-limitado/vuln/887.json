  "vulnerabilities": ["Insecure Randomness", "Potential Information Exposure"],
  "description": "The function uses Math.random() for generating random values which is not cryptographically secure. This can lead to predictable randomness vulnerability. Also, the function does not encrypt sensitive data (password and message) which can lead to potential information exposure."
