  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)", "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Prototype Pollution", "Denial of Service"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution which can lead to multiple application-level vulnerabilities such as Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, or even Cross-Site Scripting. This happens because the function does not prevent the modification of the Object prototype. Also, the function does not have a mechanism to prevent a large amount of data to be processed, which can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack."
