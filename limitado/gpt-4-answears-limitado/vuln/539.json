  "vulnerabilities": ["Command Injection", "Improper Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection because it directly includes user input (req.query.url) in a command that is executed by the system. An attacker could potentially provide a malicious URL that includes command line instructions, which would then be executed by the server. Additionally, there is no validation of the user input, which further increases the risk of command injection."
