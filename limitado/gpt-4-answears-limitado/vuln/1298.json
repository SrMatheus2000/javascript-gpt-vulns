  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-89", "CWE-20", "CWE-79"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["SQL Injection", "Improper Input Validation", "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection because it uses user input directly in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the SQL query and potentially access, modify or delete data in the database. The function also lacks proper input validation, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) because it directly uses user input in the response without proper sanitization, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts and execute them in the user's browser."
