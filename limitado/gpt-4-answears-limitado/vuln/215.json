  "CWEs": ["CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Command Injection"],
  "description": "The function 'execTag' is vulnerable to command injection. This is because it constructs a command string using user-supplied input (newVersion, args) and then executes it using 'runExec'. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by providing specially crafted input."
