  "isVulnerable": true,

  "description": "The function 'executeCommand' is vulnerable to OS command injection because it directly uses the 'cmd' parameter in the 'exec' function without any sanitization or validation. An attacker could provide a malicious command as the 'cmd' parameter, which would then be executed by the server."
