  "description": "The provided JavaScript function does not appear to have any obvious vulnerabilities. It checks for null or undefined values, handles arrays and plain objects, and converts other values to strings. It does not execute any potentially unsafe operations such as eval(), does not modify any global objects, and does not seem to be susceptible to common JavaScript vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Prototype Pollution."
