  "description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks. It constructs an SQL query by concatenating user-supplied input (the 'object' parameter) without properly sanitizing it. An attacker could potentially provide specially crafted input that modifies the SQL query in a way that could lead to unauthorized data access, data corruption, or other unintended behavior."
