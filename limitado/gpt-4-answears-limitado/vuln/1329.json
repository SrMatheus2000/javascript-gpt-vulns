  "vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection", "Argument Injection", "Improper Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection because it concatenates user-supplied input (arrParams) into a command string that is executed by the system. An attacker could provide malicious input that alters the command to perform unintended actions. This is a violation of CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command). Additionally, the function does not validate or sanitize the input, which is a violation of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation). The function is also vulnerable to argument injection (CWE-88) because it concatenates user-supplied input into the arguments of the command."
