  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it directly injects the response from the server into the HTML DOM without proper sanitization or encoding. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, which would be executed in the context of the victim's session. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) because it does not validate or verify the origin of the request, allowing an attacker to trick a victim into making an unwanted request."
