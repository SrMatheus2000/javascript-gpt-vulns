  "description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the 'options' object that is passed to it. This can lead to code injection if an attacker can control the contents of 'options'. For example, an attacker could pass a function in 'options.tocCallback' that executes arbitrary code. Additionally, the function does not validate the 'md' parameter, which could lead to unexpected behavior if 'md' is not the expected type or structure."
