  "vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to code injection because it concatenates the 'options' parameter directly into a command string that is executed without any sanitization. An attacker could provide malicious input in 'options' that alters the command to perform unintended actions."
