  "description": "The function is vulnerable to timing attacks. The comparison of the HMAC in the for loop can take different amounts of time depending on how many characters match before a mismatch is found. This can allow an attacker to guess the HMAC one character at a time by observing how long the function takes to return an error. To fix this, a constant time comparison function should be used."
