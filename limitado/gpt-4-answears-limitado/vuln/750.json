  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly inserts user-controlled data (the 'data' parameter) into the output without properly sanitizing or escaping it. An attacker could exploit this by providing malicious script content as 'data', which would then be executed when the output is rendered in a web browser."
