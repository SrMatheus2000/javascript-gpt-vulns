  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection"],
  "description": "The function 'compile' is vulnerable to code injection. It uses the 'new Function' constructor to create a new function from a string. This is dangerous as it allows for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the 'format' parameter, which would then be executed. This could lead to a variety of security issues, including data theft, data corruption, or denial of service."
