  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'data' parameter is directly inserted into the HTML content of the '#message-bar' element without any sanitization or encoding. This means that if an attacker can control the value of 'data', they can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the page, which will be executed in the context of the user's session."
