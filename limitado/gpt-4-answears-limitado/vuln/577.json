  "description": "The function seems to be vulnerable to Path Traversal attacks (CWE-22). It uses 'entry.absolute' as a parameter for several file system operations without validating or sanitizing it. An attacker could potentially manipulate 'entry.absolute' to navigate the file system outside of the intended scope, allowing them to read, write, or delete files that they should not have access to."
