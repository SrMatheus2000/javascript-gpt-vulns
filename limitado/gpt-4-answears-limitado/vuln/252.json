  "description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection because it concatenates user-supplied input into a command that is executed synchronously by the child_process.execSync function. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. Additionally, the function uses user-supplied input to construct file paths, which could lead to path traversal vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized. Finally, the function is vulnerable to code injection because it uses user-supplied input to construct a command that is executed by the child_process.execSync function."
