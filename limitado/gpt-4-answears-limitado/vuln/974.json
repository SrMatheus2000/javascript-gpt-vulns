  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it takes an 'element' parameter and directly injects it into the HTML of an iframe without properly sanitizing or escaping it. An attacker could potentially provide a malicious string as 'element', which would then be executed as script in the context of the user's browser when the iframe is loaded. This could lead to various harmful actions such as stealing sensitive data or performing actions on behalf of the user."
