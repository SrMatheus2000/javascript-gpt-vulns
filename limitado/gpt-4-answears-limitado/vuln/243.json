  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses the 'row' variable to set the innerHTML of the 'divRow' element. If the 'row' variable contains malicious script, it will be executed when the HTML is rendered. This can lead to various attacks such as stealing user's cookies, performing actions on behalf of the user, etc."
