  "vulnerabilities": ["Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "Improper Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) as it does not limit the number of worker processes that can be created. This can lead to resource exhaustion if an attacker sends a large number of requests. Additionally, the function does not validate the input received in the 'message' event (CWE-20). This can lead to unexpected behavior if the input is not in the expected format or contains malicious data."
