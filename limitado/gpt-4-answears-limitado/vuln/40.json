  "description": "The function checkGraphvizInstalled is vulnerable to OS command injection. The function uses the exec function to execute a command that is constructed by joining the user-supplied input (config.graphVizPath) with a static string. If an attacker can control the value of config.graphVizPath, they can inject arbitrary commands to be executed by the system."
