  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Potential Denial of Service (DoS)", "Potential Null Pointer Dereference"],
  "description": "The function does not validate the input parameters before using them. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the parameters are not as expected. For example, if 'guest' or 'options' are null, the function will throw an error when trying to access their properties, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). Similarly, if 'frameName' is null, the function will throw an error when trying to use it as a key in the 'frameToGuest' object. This is a potential Null Pointer Dereference vulnerability."
