  "description": "The function seems to be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that it directly uses user input in the creation of HTML content (e.g., `data.text = tmp.html();`). An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the page, leading to various security issues such as data theft, session hijacking, defacement of the website, etc."
