  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function uses the 'msg', 'url', and 'linenumber' parameters in the HTML content without properly sanitizing them. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through these parameters, which will be executed when the HTML content is rendered in a web browser. The function should sanitize these parameters before using them in the HTML content to prevent XSS attacks."
