  "CWEs": ["CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that it directly uses user input in the DOM via the jQuery .html() method. This method interprets the input as HTML, which allows an attacker to inject scripts that will be executed by the browser. The vulnerability occurs in the following line: 'target.parent().html(input);'. An attacker could potentially manipulate the 'input' variable to include malicious scripts."
