  "description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection as it uses user-supplied input in a command that is executed by a system function. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. The function also exposes sensitive information by including the password in the command line arguments, which can be seen by other users on the system. Additionally, the function does not limit the amount of resources it can consume, which can lead to a denial of service if an attacker provides a large amount of data."
