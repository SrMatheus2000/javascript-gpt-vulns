  "": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks because it directly uses user input as HTML content through 'innerHTML'. An attacker could inject malicious scripts by providing an 'option.text' that includes script tags. This script would then be executed when the HTML is rendered in the browser."
