  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"],
  "description": "The function uses a regular expression (regex) to parse the input 'a'. This regex is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks. If an attacker provides a specially crafted string that results in excessive backtracking, it could cause the application to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service. This is due to the use of the '.*?' pattern, which can lead to catastrophic backtracking. Additionally, the function does not validate the input 'a', which could lead to further vulnerabilities."
