  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it directly uses the request content without sanitizing it, which can lead to the execution of malicious scripts. It also lacks proper input validation, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the input is not as expected. Additionally, the function logs the request and response objects, which can lead to sensitive information leakage if these objects contain such information. It also does not neutralize the output for logs, which can lead to log injection if the request or response contains newline or return characters."
