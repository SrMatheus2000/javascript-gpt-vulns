  "description": "The function is vulnerable to injection attacks as it does not properly validate or sanitize the 'result' input before processing it. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code or data, leading to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function does not limit the size of the 'result' input, which could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if an attacker sends a large amount of data, consuming server resources."
