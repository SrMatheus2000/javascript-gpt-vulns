  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Type confusion", "Potential null or undefined object dereference"],
  "description": "The function does not validate the input parameters 'key' and 'index'. This can lead to type confusion vulnerabilities if the function is called with unexpected types. Additionally, the function does not check if 'o' is defined before accessing its properties, which can lead to null or undefined object dereference."
