  "description "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function directly inserts user-controlled data ('data-vimeoparams') into HTML content ('iframe src'). An attacker could inject malicious scripts into 'data-vimeoparams', which would then be executed in the context of the victim's session. This could lead to session hijacking, identity theft, defacement of the website, or other attacks."
