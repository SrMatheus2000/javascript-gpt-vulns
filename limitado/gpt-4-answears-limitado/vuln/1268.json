  "description": "The function 'decodeComponent' is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. It uses 'decodeURIComponent' to decode URL components, but it doesn't properly sanitize the input. This means that if an attacker can control the input to this function, they could inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the context of the user's browser. This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
