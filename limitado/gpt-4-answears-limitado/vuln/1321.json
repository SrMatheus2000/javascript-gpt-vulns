  "vulnerabilities": ["Prototype Pollution"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. It does not validate or sanitize the 'key' input which can be manipulated to modify the prototype of the object. This can lead to several security issues like adding or modifying existing properties that will be inherited by all objects. This can further lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or even lead to other vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)."
