  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal attack. Although it checks for '../' to prevent directory traversal, it does not consider encoded versions of '../' such as '%2e%2e%2f'. An attacker can bypass the check by using URL encoded or double URL encoded versions of '../'. This can allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server."
