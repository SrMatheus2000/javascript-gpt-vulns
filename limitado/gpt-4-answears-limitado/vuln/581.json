  "description": "The loadImage function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks because it does not properly sanitize the 'image' input before using it to create an Image object or XMLHttpRequest. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through the 'image' parameter, which would then be executed in the context of the user's browser. Additionally, the function does not validate the 'image' input before using it, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors."
