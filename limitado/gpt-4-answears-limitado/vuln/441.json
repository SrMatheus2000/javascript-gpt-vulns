  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) as it does not implement any CSRF protection mechanism. An attacker can trick a victim into making a request that the victim did not intend to make. Additionally, the function does not validate or sanitize the 'req.headers.origin' input before using it to set the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header. This can lead to potential security issues."
