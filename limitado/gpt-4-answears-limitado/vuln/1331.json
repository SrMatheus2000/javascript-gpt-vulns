  "description": "The function is vulnerable to several types of attacks. The 'expandPath' function can lead to Path Traversal vulnerabilities (CWE-22) as it resolves file paths without proper validation or sanitization. The 'grep' function uses 'exec' to run shell commands, which can lead to OS Command Injection (CWE-78) if the 'config.grep' or 'config.grepDir' variables are controlled by an attacker.
