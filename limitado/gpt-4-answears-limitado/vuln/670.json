  "description": "The function is vulnerable to JSON Injection because it uses JSON.parse() on the 'value' parameter without validating the input. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the JSON, leading to various attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or even Remote Code Execution (RCE). Additionally, the function does not limit the size of the parsed JSON object, which could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if an attacker sends a very large JSON object, causing the application to consume excessive resources while processing it."
