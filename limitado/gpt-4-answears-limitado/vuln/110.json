  "vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection", "Improper Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to code injection attacks. This is because it uses the input directly in a function call without proper sanitization or validation. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code through the 'val' parameter, which could lead to arbitrary code execution. Additionally, the function does not validate the input properly, which could lead to other types of attacks such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)."
