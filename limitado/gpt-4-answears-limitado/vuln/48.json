  "description": "The function loadProject is vulnerable to path traversal attacks. The function does not properly sanitize the 'name' parameter, which is used to construct a file path. An attacker could potentially manipulate the 'name' parameter to navigate the file system outside of the intended directory. This could allow an attacker to read, write, or delete files that they should not have access to. This vulnerability is classified as CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')."
