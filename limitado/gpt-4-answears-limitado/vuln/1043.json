  "vulnerabilities": ["Prototype Pollution"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution which is a serious security vulnerability. The function does not validate the input for the 'path' parameter. If the path is '__proto__.toString' or '__proto__.valueOf', it can add or modify properties of the Object prototype. This can lead to various security issues like denial of service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), or even lead to other vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)."
