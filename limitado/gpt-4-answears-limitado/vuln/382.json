  "description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection and argument injection. This is because it uses user-supplied input in shell commands without proper sanitization or validation. For example, the `remoteUrl`, `startTag`, `endTag`, `ignoredFiles`, `startCommand`, `endCommand` variables are used in shell commands without any checks. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands or arguments, leading to arbitrary command execution on the server."
