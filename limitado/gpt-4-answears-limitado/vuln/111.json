  "description": "The function does not properly validate the input 'data'. It attempts to convert non-string data to a string using the toString method, which can lead to unexpected behavior or Type Coercion vulnerabilities. Additionally, the function constructs a regular expression using user-controlled data (this.options.sectionOpenIdentifier and this.options.sectionCloseIdentifier), which can lead to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) if the user provides a malicious input. Furthermore, the function uses the user-controlled input to create keys and values in an object, which can potentially lead to Code Injection if the object
