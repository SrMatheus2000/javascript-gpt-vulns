  "description": "The function is vulnerable to URL redirection attacks. The function takes the hash part of the URL and uses it to redirect the user. However, it does not validate or sanitize the URL before redirecting. This could allow an attacker to craft a URL that redirects a user to an arbitrary website, potentially for phishing or other malicious purposes."
