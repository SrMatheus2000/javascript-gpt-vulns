  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input (req.urlBase) in file system operations without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access, read, or modify files outside of the intended directories. Additionally, the function may expose sensitive information (CWE-200) through error messages or other responses."
