  "vulnerabilities": ["Command Injection"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection. It concatenates the 'options' parameter directly into a command string without any sanitization or escaping. This means that if a user can control the 'options' parameter, they can inject arbitrary commands to be executed."
