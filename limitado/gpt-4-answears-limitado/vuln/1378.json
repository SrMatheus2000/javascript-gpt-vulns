  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input (moduleVer) to construct a file path without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete files outside of the intended directory. It's also vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (CWE-94) as it downloads and executes a file from a remote server without any validation. If the server is compromised, or if an attacker can manipulate the request, this could lead to arbitrary code execution. Lastly, it's vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) as it doesn't limit the size of the file being downloaded, which could lead
