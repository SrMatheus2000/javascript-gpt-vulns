  "description": "The function seems to be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, as it directly uses user input in Mustache.render() and Signal.HTML.render() without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts. Also, there is no proper input validation before using the user-provided data, which leads to Improper Input Validation vulnerability."
