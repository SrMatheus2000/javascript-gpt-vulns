  "description": "The function does not sanitize the 'html' and 'author' inputs before inserting them into the HTML content. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute scripts in the victim's browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites."
