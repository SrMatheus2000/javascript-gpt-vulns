  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks because it does not limit the size of the image that can be requested. This can lead to excessive resource consumption (CWE-400). Additionally, the function exposes potentially sensitive information in error messages (CWE-209). The function also does not validate or sanitize the URL parameter, which could lead to path traversal attacks (CWE-22)."
