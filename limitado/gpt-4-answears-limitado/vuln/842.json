  "description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the 'method' and 'contentType' variables which are directly used in the function logic. This could lead to vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, where an attacker could inject malicious SQL commands, and Cross-site Scripting, where an attacker could inject malicious scripts, if the function is used in a web application context. Additionally, the function does not validate the 'params', 'req', and 'res' inputs, which could lead to other potential vulnerabilities."
