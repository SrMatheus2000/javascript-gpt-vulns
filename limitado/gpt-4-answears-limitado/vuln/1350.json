  "description": "The function doNpmCommand is vulnerable to command injection. This is because it constructs a command string with user-supplied input (options.npmCommand, options.cmdArgs, options.cmdOptions) and then executes it using the exec function. An attacker could potentially inject arbitrary commands by supplying specially crafted input."
