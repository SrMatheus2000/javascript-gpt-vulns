  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The function does not validate the 'header' input properly. If an attacker provides a large 'header' input, the function will consume a lot of resources (CPU and memory) when splitting the 'header' and matching the ranges, which can lead to a DoS condition. Additionally, the function does not validate the 'length' input, which can lead to unexpected behavior if an attacker provides a negative number or a non-integer value."
