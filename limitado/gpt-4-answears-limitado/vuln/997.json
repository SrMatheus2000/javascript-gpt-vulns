  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function 'convertToSVG' is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it takes an input string '_str' and directly uses it to generate SVG without properly sanitizing the input. An attacker can inject malicious scripts in the input string which will be executed when the SVG is rendered in a web page. This can lead to various attacks such as stealing sensitive information, session hijacking, defacement of the website, etc."
