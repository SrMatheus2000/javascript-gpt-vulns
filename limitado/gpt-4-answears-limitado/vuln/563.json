  "description": "The function uses a loose comparison (==) instead of a strict comparison (===), which can lead to unexpected type coercion vulnerabilities. The function also exposes the password in plain text, which is a security risk. The function does not implement any form of password hashing or encryption, which is a standard security practice. Furthermore, the function assumes that the 'users' data is immutable, which can lead to authentication bypass if the 'users' data can be manipulated."
