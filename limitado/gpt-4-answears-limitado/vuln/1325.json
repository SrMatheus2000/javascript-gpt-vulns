  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Information Disclosure and Denial of Service attacks. In the case of an error, the function throws the error object which might expose sensitive information (CWE-209). Also, the function does not control the number of tasks that can be pushed into the 'tasks' array, which can lead to resource exhaustion if a large number of tasks are added (CWE-400)."
