  "description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the 'params' input, which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the input is controlled by an attacker. This can allow the attacker to inject malicious scripts that can steal sensitive information, perform actions on behalf of the user, or deface the website. The function also does not check if 'params' is an object before treating it as such, which can lead to unexpected behavior if 'params' is not an object."
