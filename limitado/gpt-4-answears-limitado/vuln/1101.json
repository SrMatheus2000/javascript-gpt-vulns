  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Potential Denial of Service (DoS)", "Uncontrolled Memory Consumption"],
  "description": "The function does not validate the input 's' before using it in the 'toLowerCase' and 'replace' methods. If 's' is not a string, this could cause a runtime error. Additionally, the function does not limit the size of the input string 's', which could lead to excessive memory consumption if a very large string is passed, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The '_hexToByte' function is also potentially dangerous if not properly implemented, as it could lead to unexpected results or security vulnerabilities."
