  "description": "The function does not properly sanitize user input, which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This occurs when the application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or escaping, or updates an existing web page with user-supplied data using a browser API that can create HTML or JavaScript. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim's browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites."
