  "description": "The function 'prepare' is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly appends the '_html' parameter to 'tooltip_div' without any sanitization or encoding. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through the '_html' parameter, which will then be executed in the user's browser when the tooltip is displayed."
