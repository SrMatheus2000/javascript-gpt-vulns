  "CWEs": ["CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Command Injection"],
  "description": "The function 'funcs' is vulnerable to command injection. The 'cmd' variable is constructed by concatenating user-controlled input ('opts' and 'range') without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed by the system."
