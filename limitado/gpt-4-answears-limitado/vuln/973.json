  "description": "The function reads files synchronously using 'fs.readFileSync' which can lead to Path Traversal (CWE-22) if the 'sslOptions' object is manipulated to include paths outside the intended directory. It also exposes sensitive information such as SSL keys and certificates (CWE-522) which should be protected. The function does not limit the number of concurrent connections to the server (CWE-400), which can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if an attacker makes a large number of simultaneous requests."
