  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Infinite Loop", "Type Coercion"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to an infinite loop if the input string does not contain the expected characters. This can lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service. Additionally, the function uses loose equality (==) instead of strict equality (===) for type comparisons, which can lead to unexpected type coercion and potentially incorrect behavior."
