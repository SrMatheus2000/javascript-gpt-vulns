  "vulnerabilities": ["Denial of Service (DoS)", "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "Improper Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function does not validate the input for 'operations' and 'map' fields before parsing them with JSON.parse, which can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if an attacker provides a large, complex object that requires significant resources to parse. Additionally, the function does not limit the size of the 'operations' and 'map' fields, which can lead to uncontrolled resource consumption if an attacker provides a large amount of data. The function also does not handle errors that may occur during the parsing of the 'operations' and 'map' fields, which can lead to unhandled exceptions and potential application crashes."
