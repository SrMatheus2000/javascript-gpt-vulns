  "description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection (CWE-89) as it directly uses user input in database queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. It is also vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79) as it does not properly sanitize user input before using it in the application's response. Additionally, the function does not implement any CSRF protections (CWE-352), making it possible for an attacker to trick a victim into executing unwanted actions on their behalf."
