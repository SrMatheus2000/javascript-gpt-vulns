  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'url', 'width', and 'height' parameters are directly concatenated into the HTML string without any sanitization or encoding, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code. This code will be executed when the resulting HTML is rendered in a web browser. The vulnerability corresponds to CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')."
