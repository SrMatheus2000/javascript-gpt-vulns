  "description": "The function is vulnerable to path traversal attacks (CWE-22) because it uses user-provided input in file system operations without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete files outside of the intended directories. The function also sets incorrect default permissions (CWE-276) which could allow unauthorized users to access or modify sensitive data. Additionally, the function uses potentially dangerous functions (CWE-676), such as 'fs.writeFile' and 'fs.chmod', which could lead to security vulnerabilities if not used correctly."
