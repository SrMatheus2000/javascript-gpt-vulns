  "description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection because it uses the execFile function without properly sanitizing the 'dest' variable, which could be manipulated to execute arbitrary commands. It also does not validate the 'url' input, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues. Additionally, the function logs potentially sensitive information such as the URL and status code, which could lead to information exposure."
