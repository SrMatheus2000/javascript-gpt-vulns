  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input in 'fileName' to access files without proper validation or sanitization, potentially allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server. It is also vulnerable to Information Exposure (CWE-200) as it reveals detailed error messages that could provide an attacker with useful information about the system."
