  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input to construct file paths without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete files outside of the intended directory. It is also vulnerable to SQL Injection (CWE-89) and Cross-site Scripting (CWE-79) as it directly uses user-supplied input in SQL queries and HTML output without proper validation or sanitization, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands or inject malicious scripts."
