  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks. The regular expression used in the function can cause exponential backtracking on certain inputs, which can lead to a denial of service. An attacker could provide a specially crafted password that, when used in the regular expression, would cause the function to consume excessive resources, potentially leading to a denial of service."
