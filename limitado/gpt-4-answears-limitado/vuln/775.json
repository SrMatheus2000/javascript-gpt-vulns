  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"],
  "description": "The function uses regular expressions (regex) to parse file headers. However, it does not validate the input before applying the regex. This can lead to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) if an attacker provides a specially crafted input that causes the regex to take a very long time to process. This can consume significant system resources, leading to a denial of service. Additionally, the variable 'diffstr[i]' is not defined in the function, which could lead to unexpected behavior."
