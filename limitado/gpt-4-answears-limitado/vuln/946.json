  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) because it uses user input to construct a file path without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker could manipulate the 'req.url' to access arbitrary files on the system. Additionally, the function may expose sensitive information (CWE-200) by revealing the existence or non-existence of specific files on the system through its error messages."
