  "description": "The function 'launch' is vulnerable to command injection because it concatenates a user-supplied input 'opts.uri' directly into a command that is executed by the system. An attacker could provide a malicious 'opts.uri' that includes command line special characters, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the system."
