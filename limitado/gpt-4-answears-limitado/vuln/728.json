  "CWEs": ["CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Command Injection"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection because it uses the 'exec' function to execute a system command and includes user-supplied input ('iface') in the command without properly sanitizing it. An attacker could provide a malicious 'iface' value that includes command injection payloads, leading to arbitrary command execution."
