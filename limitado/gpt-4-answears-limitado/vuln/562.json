  "description": "The function takes an HTML string as input and processes it to generate a new HTML string. However, it does not sanitize the input HTML string before processing it. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the HTML, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. XSS attacks can lead to a variety of security issues, including session hijacking, identity theft, and defacement of the website."
