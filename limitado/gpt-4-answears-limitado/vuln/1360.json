  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly inserts user input into HTML templates without proper sanitization or encoding. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts by providing specially crafted input for 'text' or 'link' parameters, which would then be executed in the context of the user's browser when the generated HTML is rendered."
