  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function _wrapMatchesInNode is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it uses the innerHTML property to insert user-controlled data into the DOM. If the data passed to the _convertUrlsToLinks function contains a malicious script, it will be executed when the data is inserted into the DOM. To mitigate this vulnerability, consider using textContent instead of innerHTML, or ensure that the data is properly sanitized before it is inserted into the DOM."
