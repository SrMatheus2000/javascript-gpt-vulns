  "CWEs": ["CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function does not sanitize the 'params' input, which could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the input is controlled by an attacker. This is especially dangerous if 'params.content' is an array, as it directly assigns the array to 'instance.$slots.default', which could be a potential point of script injection. It is recommended to sanitize all user inputs and use safe methods to manipulate the DOM."
