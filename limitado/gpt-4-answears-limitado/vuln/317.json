  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Timing Attack"],
  "description": "The function pointFpMultiply(k) is vulnerable to timing attacks. This is because the time taken by the function can vary depending on the input, which can potentially reveal sensitive information about the secret key 'k'. This is a common vulnerability in cryptographic algorithms that do not implement constant-time operations. A malicious actor could potentially determine 'k' by measuring the time it takes for the function to execute."
