  "": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the use of template literals to inject user-controlled data (`props.suggestionText` and `value[props.displayKey]`) directly into HTML content. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through these properties, which would then be executed in the context of the user's browser when the rendered HTML content is viewed."
