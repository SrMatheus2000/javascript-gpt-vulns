  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input (moduleVer) to construct a file path without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete files outside of the intended directory. It's also vulnerable to Code Injection (CWE-94) as it uses user-supplied input to construct a URL for downloading a file, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Lastly, it's vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) as it doesn't limit the size of the file being downloaded, which could lead to a denial of service if an attacker provides a URL for a large
