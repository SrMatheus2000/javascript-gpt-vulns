  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input from 'req.url' to construct a file path without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access sensitive files outside of the intended directory. Additionally, the function may expose sensitive information (CWE-200) through error messages or other responses."
