  "description": "The function createPrivateKey is vulnerable due to several reasons. Firstly, it does not validate the input for 'keyBitsize', 'options', and 'callback' which can lead to unexpected behavior (CWE-20). Secondly, it uses a default keyBitsize of 2048 if none is provided, which may not be secure enough for certain applications (CWE-310). Lastly, the function may expose sensitive information such as the private key and password if an error occurs during the execution of the openssl command (CWE-200)."
