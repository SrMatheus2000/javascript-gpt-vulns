  "description": "The function is vulnerable as it downloads and includes functionality from an untrusted source (scala-js.org) without any form of verification, which can lead to the inclusion of malicious code. This is identified as CWE-829. Additionally, the function constructs a URL using string concatenation with user-controlled variables (scalaVersion and scalaJsVersion), which can lead to code injection (CWE-94) if the variables are manipulated to alter the URL."
