  "description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function does not properly sanitize user input, which can be manipulated to execute arbitrary SQL commands or inject malicious scripts. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data corruption, or even remote code execution. The function should use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL Injection attacks, and sanitize user input to prevent XSS attacks."
