  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Prototype Pollution"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution which allows an attacker to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. This can lead to several types of attacks like denial of service (DoS), property override, or potentially remote code execution. The vulnerability occurs because the function does not validate the keys of the input object, allowing an attacker to modify the prototype of 'Object' and inject malicious code."
