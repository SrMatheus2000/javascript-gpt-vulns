  "description": "The function allows for unrestricted file uploads, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if an attacker is able to upload a script file. Additionally, the function does not properly limit or sanitize the upload directory path, which can lead to path traversal attacks, allowing an attacker to read, write, or delete files outside of the intended directory."
