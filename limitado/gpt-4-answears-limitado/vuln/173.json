  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-78"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection"],
  "description": "The function 'ffmpeg' is vulnerable to OS command injection because it directly uses the 'os' parameter in the 'command' function without any sanitization or validation. An attacker could potentially pass a malicious string as 'os' that could execute arbitrary commands on the system."
