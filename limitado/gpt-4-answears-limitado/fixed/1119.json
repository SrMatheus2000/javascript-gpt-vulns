  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks because it directly injects user-controlled data into the HTML document without properly sanitizing or escaping it. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, which would be executed in the context of the victim's browser. The function also fails to properly encode or escape output, which could lead to injection attacks."
