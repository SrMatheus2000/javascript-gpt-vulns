  "description": "The function does not properly sanitize the input for the 'val' parameter, which is used in SQL queries. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, leading to SQL Injection attacks. The 'escape' function is used to sanitize some inputs, but not all, leaving the function vulnerable. It is recommended to always sanitize user inputs that will be used in SQL queries to prevent SQL Injection attacks."
