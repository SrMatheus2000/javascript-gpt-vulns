  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct a file path without properly validating or sanitizing the input, which could allow an attacker to access arbitrary files. It's also vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) as it reads files synchronously which could lead to denial of service if a large file is requested. Lastly, it's vulnerable to Improper Resource Shutdown or Release (CWE-404) as it does not properly handle errors that may occur during file operations, potentially leaving resources in an inconsistent state."
