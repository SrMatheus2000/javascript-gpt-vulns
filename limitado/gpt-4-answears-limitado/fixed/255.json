  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that user-supplied input is directly embedded into the HTML document without proper sanitization or encoding, specifically in the 'embedVimeoIframe' and 'embedYoutubeIframe' functions where the 'id' and 'vimeoParams'/'youtubeParams' are directly inserted into the iframe src attribute.
