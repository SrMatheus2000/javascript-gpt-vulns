  "description": "The function is vulnerable to code injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The function parses input data without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker could inject malicious code as a string, which would then be executed when the JSON.parse() function is called. This could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the application. Additionally, if the parsed data is used in the HTML context without proper encoding, it could lead to XSS attacks."
