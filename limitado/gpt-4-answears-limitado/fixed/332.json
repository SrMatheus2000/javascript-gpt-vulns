  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'url' and 'text' parameters are directly inserted into the HTML without proper sanitization or encoding. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through these parameters, which would then be executed in the user's browser when the page is rendered. This could lead to various harmful actions such as stealing sensitive information, performing actions on behalf of the user, or delivering malware."
