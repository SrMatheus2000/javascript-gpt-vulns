  "description": "The setText function directly sets the textContent of an element to a value or a property from the state. If the state or value is user-controlled and not properly sanitized, this could lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

If the state is user-controlled and not properly sanitized, this could also lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability."
