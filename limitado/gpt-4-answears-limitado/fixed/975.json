  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) because it downloads a file from a URL that is constructed by concatenating a static string with a value returned by the getArchiveName() function. If an attacker can control the value returned by getArchiveName(), they can force the server to make a HTTP GET request to an arbitrary URL. This could be used to attack internal resources that are not normally accessible. Additionally, there is no validation of the response.statusCode, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the server returns an error status code."
