  "description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection. The 'scanner' parameter is used to construct a command that is then executed. If an attacker can control the 'scanner' parameter, they can inject arbitrary commands to be executed. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including data theft, data corruption, denial of service, and even full system compromise."
