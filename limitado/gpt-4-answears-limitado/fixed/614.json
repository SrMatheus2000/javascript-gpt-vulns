  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Memory Leak"],
  "description": "The function does not have a mechanism to limit the size of the cache. If the function is called repeatedly with different arguments, the cache size will grow indefinitely, leading to a potential memory leak. This can cause the application to slow down or crash due to out of memory error."
