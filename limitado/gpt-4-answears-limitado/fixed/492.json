  "description": "The function does not properly sanitize the 'header.name' input, which is used to construct a file path. This could allow an attacker to traverse the file system to arbitrary locations or include arbitrary files. The function also does not properly control or restrict the file name or path, which could allow an attacker to create or overwrite arbitrary files."
