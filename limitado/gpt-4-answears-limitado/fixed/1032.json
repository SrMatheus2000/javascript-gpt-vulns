  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Insecure use of 'Buffer'"],
  "description": "The function uses the 'Buffer' constructor, which is considered insecure because it can lead to various security issues if not used properly. If the input is a number, the Buffer constructor can lead to uninitialized memory leaks. It's recommended to use 'Buffer.from', 'Buffer.alloc', or 'Buffer.allocUnsafe' instead."
