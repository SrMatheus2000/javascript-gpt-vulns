  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct a file path without proper validation or sanitization, potentially allowing an attacker to access arbitrary files. It may also be vulnerable to SQL Injection (CWE-89) and Cross-site Scripting (CWE-79) attacks, as it appears to directly use user input in database queries and HTML output without proper validation or sanitization."
