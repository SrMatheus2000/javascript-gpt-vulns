  "vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection"],
  "description": "The function scanWifi is vulnerable to OS command injection. The function uses the execFile function to execute the 'nmcli' command with user-supplied input (config.iface). If an attacker can control the 'config.iface' value, they can inject arbitrary commands to be executed by the system. This can lead to various security issues such as unauthorized access, data leakage, denial of service, etc."
