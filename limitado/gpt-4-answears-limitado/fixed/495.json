  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it uses the 'insertAdjacentHTML' method which can execute JavaScript code if it is present in the string being inserted. If an attacker can control the 'character' option in the 'opts' parameter, they could inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed when the function is called."
