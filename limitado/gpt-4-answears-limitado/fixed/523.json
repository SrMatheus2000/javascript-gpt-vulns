  "description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection because it concatenates user-supplied input into command parameters without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands. It is also vulnerable to Path Traversal as it uses user-supplied input in file paths without proper validation or sanitization, potentially allowing an attacker to access sensitive files. Lastly, the function is vulnerable to Insufficiently Protected Credentials because it uses plaintext passwords without any form of encryption or hashing, potentially exposing sensitive user credentials."
