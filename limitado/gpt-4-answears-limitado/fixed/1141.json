  "description": "The function setupGlobalExceptionHandler() is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function uses the jQuery .html() method to insert error messages into the DOM. If an attacker can control the 'msg', 'url', or 'linenumber' parameters, they could inject malicious scripts into the web page. Although the function attempts to sanitize the 'navigator.userAgent' input with the 'padutils.escapeHtml()' function, it does not sanitize the 'msg', 'url', or 'linenumber' inputs. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session."
