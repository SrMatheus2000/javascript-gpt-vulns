  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Type confusion", "Potential null pointer dereference"],
  "description": "The function does not validate the type of the input 'obj'. If 'obj' is not an object or array, the function will throw a TypeError when it tries to call Object.keys(obj). This is a type confusion vulnerability. Additionally, the function does not check if 'this' is null before calling 'this.useBrackets', 'this.dot', and 'this.separator'. If 'this' is null, the function will throw a TypeError. This is a potential null pointer dereference vulnerability."
