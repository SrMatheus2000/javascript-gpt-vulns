  "description": "The function is vulnerable as it exposes potentially sensitive information through error messages (CWE-209). In the catch block, the error message is directly set as the value of the CodeMirror instance, which could reveal system details or other sensitive information to the user. Additionally, the function uses the 'setValue' method of the CodeMirror instance, which can be potentially dangerous if the content set is not properly sanitized or validated (CWE-749)."
