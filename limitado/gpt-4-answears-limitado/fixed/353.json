  "vulnerabilities": ["Prototype Pollution"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution which can lead to several injection vulnerabilities. The function does not properly validate the input and allows modification of the prototype of 'Object' when '__proto__' or 'constructor' properties are modified. An attacker can manipulate these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values. This can influence the behaviour of the application and lead to Remote Code Execution or even Denial of Service."
