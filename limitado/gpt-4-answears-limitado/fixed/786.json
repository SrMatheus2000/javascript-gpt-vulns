  "description": "The function uses SHA-1, which is a weak hash function that can be reversed. This means that if an attacker gets hold of the hashed password, they can potentially reverse-engineer the original password. Additionally, the function does not use a salt in the hashing process, which makes it vulnerable to rainbow table attacks. A salt is a random value that is used as an additional input to the hash function to protect against these types of attacks. Furthermore, the function uses a predictable salt (
