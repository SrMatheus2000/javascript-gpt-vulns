  "description": "The function isSafe checks if the user agent string contains more than 100 consecutive alphanumeric characters. It does not have any apparent vulnerabilities as it does not perform any unsafe operations such as eval, does not use any deprecated or potentially unsafe JavaScript features, and does not interact with the DOM or any other objects that could be manipulated by an attacker. It also does not seem to be susceptible to any common JavaScript vulnerabilities such as prototype pollution or regular expression denial of service (ReDoS)."
