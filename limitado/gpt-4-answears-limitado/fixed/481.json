  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'linkStr' parameter is directly used to set the 'link' property of vertices without proper sanitization or encoding, which can lead to XSS if 'linkStr' contains malicious scripts. This is especially true when the 'securityLevel' is not set to 'strict'. Additionally, the function does not validate the 'ids' parameter, which can lead to unexpected behavior if 'ids' is not a string or does not contain valid ids."
