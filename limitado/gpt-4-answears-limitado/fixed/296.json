  "description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection. The 'repo.organization', 'repo.name', and 'repo.branch' variables are used to construct a command that is executed by the child process. If an attacker can control the values of these variables, they can inject arbitrary commands to be executed on the server. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including data theft, data corruption, denial-of-service, or even full system compromise."
