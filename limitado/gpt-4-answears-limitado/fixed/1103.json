  "description": "The provided JavaScript function does not appear to have any obvious security vulnerabilities. It uses the escapeHtml function to sanitize the table name before it is used in a query, which should prevent SQL injection attacks. The function also uses AJAX to send a GET request, which could potentially expose sensitive data if the request is intercepted, but this is a risk inherent in any web application and not a specific vulnerability of this function."
