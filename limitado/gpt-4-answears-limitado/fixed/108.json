It is a simple function that defines a syntax highlighting scheme for the Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF). It does not perform any dangerous operations such as eval(), does not manipulate the DOM, and does not handle any user input directly, which are common sources of vulnerabilities in JavaScript."
