  "description": "The function uses crypto.randomBytes(1)[0] to generate a random number, which only provides 256 possible values. This is a small number and can be easily brute-forced, leading to predictability in the output of the function. This is especially problematic if this function is used in security-critical contexts, such as generating cryptographic keys, random nonces, or other similar uses."
