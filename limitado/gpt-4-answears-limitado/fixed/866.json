  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Null Pointer Dereference", "Improper Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function does not validate the input 'postData' and 'results' which can lead to null pointer dereference if 'postData' or 'results' is null or undefined. This can cause the application to crash. Also, the function does not validate the 'postObj.uid' and 'postObj.handle' before using them which can lead to improper input validation vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by passing malicious data in 'postObj.uid' and 'postObj.handle'."
