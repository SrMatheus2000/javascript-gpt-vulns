  "vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection"],
  "description": "The function 'ffmpeg' is vulnerable to OS command injection. The function takes an 'os' object as an argument and uses its 'file' and 'args' properties to execute a command. If an attacker can control the 'file' or 'args' properties, they can execute arbitrary commands on the system. This is a serious security issue that can lead to full system compromise."
