  "description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the 'Item.note' input, which is used in a split operation and a loop. This could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if an attacker provides a large input, causing the application to consume excessive resources and potentially crash. This is known as a Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability. Additionally, the function does not check if 'Item' is null or undefined before accessing its 'note' property, which could lead to a TypeError."
