  "description": "The function 'serialize' is vulnerable to code injection. This is because it directly uses the 'toString' method on the 'source' object without proper sanitization or validation, which can lead to execution of arbitrary code if the 'source' object contains malicious code. Additionally, the function does not validate the input 'source' object, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors."
