  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal attacks (also known as Directory Traversal). This is due to the fact that user input is used to construct file paths in a way that could allow an attacker to access arbitrary files and directories stored on the file system. The vulnerability lies in the 'filename' variable which is directly influenced by 'ctx.path', a value that can be controlled by an attacker. An attacker could manipulate 'ctx.path' to include sequences like '../' to escape the intended directory and access sensitive files."
