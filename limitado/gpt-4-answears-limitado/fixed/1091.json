  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'name' parameter is directly concatenated into the HTML string without proper sanitization or encoding, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code. This can lead to various attacks such as stealing sensitive information, performing actions on behalf of the user, or defacing the website. The 'size' and 'lastModified' parameters might also be vulnerable if they can be controlled by an attacker and are not properly validated."
