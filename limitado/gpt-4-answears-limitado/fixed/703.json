  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct a file path without properly validating or sanitizing the input, which could allow an attacker to access arbitrary files. It's also vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) as it reads files synchronously which could lead to denial of service if a large file is requested. Lastly, it's vulnerable to Information Exposure Through an Error Message (CWE-209) as it directly sends the error message to the client which could expose sensitive information."
