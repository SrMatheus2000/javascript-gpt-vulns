  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'id' variable is directly concatenated into the HTML string without any sanitization or encoding, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts. The 'val' variable is also used to create a new span with jQuery's .text() method, which is safe, but then it's used again in the 'xbutton' HTML string with the .html() method, which could be unsafe if 'val' contains any HTML tags or entities. The 'key' variable is also directly used in the HTML string without any sanitization or encoding."
