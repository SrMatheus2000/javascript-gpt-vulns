  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal and Null Byte Injection attacks. The Path Traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) exists because the function does not properly sanitize the 'ReceivedPath' input, which could allow an attacker to access arbitrary files on the system. The Null Byte Injection vulnerability (CWE-158) exists because the function does not properly handle null bytes in the 'ReceivedPath' input, which could allow an attacker to manipulate the resulting path."
