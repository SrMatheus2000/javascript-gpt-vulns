  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that it directly uses user input in the generation of HTML content. An attacker could inject malicious scripts through the user input, which would then be executed in the browser of any user viewing the generated HTML. This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing user's cookies or performing actions on behalf of the user."
