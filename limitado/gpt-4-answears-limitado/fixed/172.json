  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that the 'slot' variable, which is derived from user input (params.message), is directly inserted into the template of the 'CustomSlot' Vue component without any sanitization or escaping. This means that if a user were to pass a string containing malicious JavaScript code as 'params.message', this code would be executed when the component is rendered."
