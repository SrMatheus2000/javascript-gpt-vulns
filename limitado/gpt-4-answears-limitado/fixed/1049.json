  "description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks. It constructs an SQL query by concatenating user-supplied input (the 'object' parameter) directly into the query. An attacker could potentially manipulate the 'object' parameter to alter the SQL query, leading to unauthorized access, data corruption, or data loss."
