  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-79"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'event.message', 'event.filename', 'event.lineno', 'event.colno', and 'event.error.stack' are directly concatenated into the 'msg' variable without any sanitization or encoding. If an attacker can control the content of these variables, they can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of the victim's session. This can lead to session hijacking, identity theft, defacement of the website, and other attacks. The vulnerability corresponds to CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')."
