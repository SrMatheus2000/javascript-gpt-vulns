  "vulnerabilities": ["Open Redirect Vulnerability"],
  "description": "The function isExternal is vulnerable to open redirect attacks. This is because it uses a regular expression to parse the URL, which can be manipulated to bypass the checks and redirect to an external site. This can be used by an attacker to trick users into visiting malicious websites. The function also does not properly validate the input, which can lead to other types of attacks."
