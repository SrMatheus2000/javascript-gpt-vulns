  "vulnerabilities": ["Type Coercion", "Potential Denial of Service"],
  "description": "The function does not properly validate the input 'obj' and 'name'. If 'obj' is not an object or 'name' is not a string, it could lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where 'obj' is null or undefined before using it in a string concatenation, which could lead to a TypeError and potential Denial of Service (DoS)."
