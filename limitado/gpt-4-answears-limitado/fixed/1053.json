  "description": "The function is vulnerable to path traversal attacks. The 'entry.path' and 'entry.linkpath' variables are directly influenced by user input and are not properly sanitized before being used to determine file paths. This could allow an attacker to escape the intended directory and read, write, or execute files elsewhere on the system."
