  "description": "The function setColorTheme uses the eval function to execute code. Even though it uses a sanitizer, it's generally a bad practice to use eval because it can lead to code injection attacks if not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially provide malicious input that gets executed, leading to unauthorized code execution."
