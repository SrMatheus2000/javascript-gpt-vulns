  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Information Disclosure (CWE-200) as it reveals whether a user with a specific email exists in the system or not. This can be exploited by an attacker to enumerate users in the system. Additionally, the function does not handle session expiration (CWE-613), which can lead to session hijacking if an attacker is able to obtain the session cookie."
