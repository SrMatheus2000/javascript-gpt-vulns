  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Prototype Pollution"],
  "description": "The function _setPath is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution because it does not validate the keyPath input. An attacker can manipulate the keyPath input to modify the prototype of the object, which can lead to several security issues like denial of service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), or even lead to other vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)."
