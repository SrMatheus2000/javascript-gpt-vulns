  "description": "The function uses the spawn function to execute a command that includes user-supplied input. This can allow an attacker to inject commands that will be run on the server. This is known as OS Command Injection vulnerability. The user-supplied input is the 'options' object, which is used to construct the 'args' array. If an attacker can control the 'options' object, they can inject arbitrary commands to be executed on the server."
