  "description": "The function is vulnerable to path traversal attacks because it uses user-supplied input to construct a file path without properly sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete files outside of the intended directory. Additionally, the function does not properly neutralize special elements in the output used by a downstream component, which could lead to code injection attacks. The function also does not limit the number of redirects, which could lead to resource exhaustion."
