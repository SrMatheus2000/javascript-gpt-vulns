  "description": "The function checkPkcs12 is vulnerable to several types of attacks. The 'bufferOrPath' parameter can be manipulated to traverse the file system (CWE-22) and access sensitive files. The 'passphrase' parameter can be used to inject malicious commands (CWE-78) as it is used in the creation of a password file without proper sanitization. The function also exposes sensitive information (CWE-200) as it returns whether the MAC verification was successful or not, which can give an attacker information about the system's cryptographic mechanisms."
