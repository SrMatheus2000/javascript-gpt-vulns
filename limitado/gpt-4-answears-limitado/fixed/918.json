  "description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection because it directly uses the 'socketIOData' object without sanitizing or validating it. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL commands. It is also vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it does not sanitize the 'socketIOData' object before using it, which can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts. Furthermore, the function does not validate the 'socketIOData' object before using it, which can lead
