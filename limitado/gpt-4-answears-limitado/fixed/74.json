It correctly checks for the '__proto__' property to prevent prototype pollution, and it also checks the types of its inputs to prevent type confusion vulnerabilities. It also does not use any dangerous functions or APIs that could lead to vulnerabilities such as code injection or cross-site scripting (XSS)."
