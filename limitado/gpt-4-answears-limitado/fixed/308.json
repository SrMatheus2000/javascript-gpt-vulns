  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input to construct file paths without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access, read, or modify files outside of the intended directory. It is also vulnerable to OS Command Injection (CWE-78) as it uses user-supplied input in OS commands without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. Code Injection (CWE-94) is possible as the function uses user-supplied input in code without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary
