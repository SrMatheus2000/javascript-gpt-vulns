  "description": "The function is vulnerable to timing attacks. The time taken by the function to compare two strings can be used to guess the string values. This is because the function uses the 'crypto.timingSafeEqual' method, which is designed to prevent timing attacks by ensuring that the time taken to compare two buffers is the same regardless of the buffers' contents. However, the function first converts the input strings to buffers of the same length, which can leak information about the length of the input strings. This can be exploited in a timing attack to guess the input strings."
