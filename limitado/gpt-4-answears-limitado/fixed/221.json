  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input to create new elements and set their text content. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts by providing input that includes script tags. These scripts would then be executed when the generated web page is loaded."
