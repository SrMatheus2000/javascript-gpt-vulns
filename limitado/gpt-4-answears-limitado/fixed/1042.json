  "description": "The function does not properly validate the input received from the client, which can lead to various types of attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, and others. It also exposes sensitive information such as file paths and system configurations, which can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access or perform other malicious activities. Additionally, the function does not limit the number of requests a client can make, which can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by consuming all available resources."
