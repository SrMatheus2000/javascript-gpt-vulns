  "description": "The function PMA_unInlineEditRow is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the use of the .html(), .append(), and .text() methods, which can interpret HTML tags and JavaScript code. If an attacker can control the input to these methods, they can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of the victim's session. This can lead to session hijacking, identity theft, defacement of the website, and other attacks."
