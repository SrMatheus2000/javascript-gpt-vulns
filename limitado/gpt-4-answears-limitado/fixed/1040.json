  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "Information Exposure", "Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) as it does not implement any form of CSRF protection. This could allow an attacker to trick a victim into performing actions on their behalf. Additionally, the function exposes sensitive information by storing privileged user data in a session cookie without proper encryption. This could potentially allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to privileged data. Lastly, the function sets a cookie with the HttpOnly flag, but does not set the 'Secure' attribute for the cookie. This means that the cookie could be transmitted over an insecure connection, which could expose it to interception by an attacker."
