  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to access files (fs.statSync(staticPath)). An attacker could manipulate the path to access sensitive files. It's also vulnerable to Code Injection (CWE-94) as it directly uses user input in the controllerInst._handleAction.call(controllerInst, params.action) function call, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Lastly, it's vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) as it does not limit the number of async setup steps that can be run, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack."
