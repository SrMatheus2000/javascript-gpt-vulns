  "vulnerabilities": ["URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function fixUrl is vulnerable as it does not properly validate the input URL. It only checks if the URL starts with the desired protocol, but does not validate the rest of the URL. This could lead to URL redirection to untrusted sites, also known as 'Open Redirect'. Additionally, if the URL contains malicious scripts, it could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function should be updated to thoroughly validate the entire URL and sanitize any potentially harmful inputs."
