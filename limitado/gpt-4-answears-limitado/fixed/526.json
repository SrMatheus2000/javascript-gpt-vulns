  "description": "The function 'createPrivateKey' is vulnerable due to several reasons. Firstly, the keyBitsize is not securely randomized, which can lead to the generation of predictable keys (CWE-330). Secondly, there is no limit on the size of the keyBitsize, which can lead to resource exhaustion (CWE-400). Lastly, the function is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks as it does not validate or sanitize the 'options' parameter before using it in the 'openssl.exec' function (CWE-918)."
