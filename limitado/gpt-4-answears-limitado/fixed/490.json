  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal attacks (also known as Directory Traversal). The 'srcpath' variable is constructed by joining user-controlled input ('header.linkname') with the current working directory. An attacker could potentially manipulate 'header.linkname' to navigate to arbitrary directories. This could lead to unauthorized access to files on the server. The vulnerability is identified as CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')."
