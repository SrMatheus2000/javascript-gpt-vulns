  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) because it uses user input to construct a file path without properly sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to access, read, or modify files outside of the intended directory. The function is also vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) because it does not limit the number of requests a client can make, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack."
