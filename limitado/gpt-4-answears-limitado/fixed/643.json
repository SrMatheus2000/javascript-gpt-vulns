  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it allows the client to specify the URL to which the server will send a request. This can be exploited to access internal resources that are not normally accessible from the outside. Additionally, the function does not validate the input URL, which can lead to unexpected behavior. The function also exposes the internal IP address (127.0.0.1), which can provide useful information to an attacker."
