  "description": "The function does not properly sanitize the 'selector' input, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts. This is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Although the function attempts to reject HTML-like strings starting with a hash, it does not prevent other forms of script injection."
