  "vulnerabilities": ["SQL Injection", "No Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection because it directly uses the 'padId' parameter in database queries without any sanitization or parameterization. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the SQL queries to access, modify, or delete data in the database. Additionally, there is no input validation performed on the 'padId' parameter, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the input is not in the expected format or type."
