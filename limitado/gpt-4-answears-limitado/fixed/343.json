  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')"],
  "description": "The function sanitizeURL is vulnerable because it only checks if the URL starts with 'javascript:', 'vbscript:', or 'data:'. An attacker could bypass this check by adding spaces or other characters before these strings. Additionally, the function does not validate or escape the output URL, which could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') vulnerabilities."
