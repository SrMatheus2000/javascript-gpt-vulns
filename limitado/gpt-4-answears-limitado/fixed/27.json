  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability exists because the function uses the 'entifyGTLTAmp' function to sanitize the 'input' parameter before inserting it into HTML. However, this function only replaces certain characters with their HTML entity equivalents, which may not be sufficient to prevent all possible XSS attacks. For example, it does not replace backticks (`), which can be used to execute JavaScript in some contexts. Additionally, the function does not sanitize the 'input.maxSize' and 'input._id' properties before inserting them into HTML, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious code."
