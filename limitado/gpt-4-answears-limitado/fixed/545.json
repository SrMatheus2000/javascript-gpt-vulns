  "vulnerabilities": ["Information Disclosure", "Cross-Site Request Forgery", "Denial of Service"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Information Disclosure as it exposes internal IP addresses in the 'x-forwarded-for' header. It is also vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) as it does not validate or check any CSRF token. Additionally, it is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks as it does not limit the number of requests a client can make, potentially leading to resource exhaustion."
