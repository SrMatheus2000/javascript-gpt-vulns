  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'email' and 'text' parameters are directly inserted into the HTML without proper sanitization or encoding, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts. The 'escape.entities' function is used, but it may not be sufficient to prevent all forms of XSS, especially if it does not encode all characters that have special meaning in HTML. The vulnerability corresponds to CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')."
