  "description": "The provided JavaScript function does not appear to contain any known vulnerabilities. It is primarily composed of type checking and utility functions, and does not perform any risky operations such as eval(), does not manipulate the DOM directly, and does not handle sensitive data. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to common JavaScript vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Eval Injection, or Data Exposure."
