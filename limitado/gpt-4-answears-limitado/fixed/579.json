It has checks in place to prevent setting dangerous properties like '__proto__' and it does not use any dangerous JavaScript functions like 'eval'. It also does not seem to have any injection vulnerabilities as it does not construct any strings that get evaluated as code or as a database query. It also does not seem to have any obvious type confusion vulnerabilities, as it checks the types of its inputs."
