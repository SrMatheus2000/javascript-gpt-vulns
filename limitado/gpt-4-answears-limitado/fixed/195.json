  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to code injection. The function interpolates user-controlled data into code that is then executed. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code. The vulnerability occurs where the function interpolates the 'res' variable with the 'data' variable, which can be controlled by the user through the 'options' parameter. If an attacker can control the 'options' parameter, they could potentially inject malicious code that would be executed by the function."
