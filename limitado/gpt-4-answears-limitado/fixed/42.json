  "description": "The function loadProject is vulnerable to Path Traversal attacks (also known as Directory Traversal). This vulnerability is due to the fact that the function uses user-supplied input (the 'name' parameter) to build a file path to be loaded without properly sanitizing it. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted 'name' parameter that includes sequences like '../' to navigate up directories, potentially allowing them to access sensitive files outside of the intended 'projectsDir' directory."
