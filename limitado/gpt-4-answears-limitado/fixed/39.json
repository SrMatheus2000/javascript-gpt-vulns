  "description": "The function is vulnerable to several issues. First, it exposes potentially sensitive information through error messages (CWE-209). This can provide an attacker with valuable information about the system. Second, it does not properly set default permissions (CWE-276), which could allow an attacker to access or modify sensitive files. Lastly, it does not properly limit a pathname to a restricted directory (CWE-22), which could allow an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory."
