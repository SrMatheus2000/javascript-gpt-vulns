  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-79"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function does not properly sanitize user input, allowing for the potential execution of malicious scripts. This is particularly evident in the 'dataselectfn' function where user input is directly used without proper sanitization. This can lead to potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks where an attacker can inject malicious scripts that can be executed on the user's browser."
