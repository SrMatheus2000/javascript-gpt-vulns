  "description": "The function jwt_decode has a vulnerability where the signature verification can be bypassed. This is due to the 'noVerify' parameter. If an attacker can control this parameter and set it to 'true', they can bypass the signature verification process, allowing them to forge JWT tokens. This vulnerability is related to CWE-347, which is about improper verification of a cryptographic signature."
