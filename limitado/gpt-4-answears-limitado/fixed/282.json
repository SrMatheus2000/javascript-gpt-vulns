  "description": "The function uses 'ethUtil.bufferToHex' for cryptographic operations which might not be secure. It's important to use secure and standard cryptographic algorithms for any cryptographic operations. Also, the function does not handle exceptions that might be thrown by 'ethUtil.bufferToHex', 'tx.getChainId()', 'tx.serialize().toString('hex)', and 'Buffer.from'. Unhandled exceptions can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) if the exceptions are not caught and handled properly."
