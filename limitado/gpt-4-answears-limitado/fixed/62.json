  "vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection", "Code Injection", "Improper Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection as it concatenates a user-controlled variable 'urlSanitized' directly into a command that is executed by the system. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. The function also does not properly validate or sanitize the 'url' input, which could lead to code injection attacks. Additionally, the function modifies the '__proto__' property of the 's[i]' object, which can lead to prototype pollution attacks if the 's[i]' object is accessible by an attacker."
