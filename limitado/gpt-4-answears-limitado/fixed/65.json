{
  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-78", "CWE-20"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection", "Improper Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection because it concatenates and executes user-supplied input in a command without proper sanitization or validation. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. The function also lacks proper input validation, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors."
