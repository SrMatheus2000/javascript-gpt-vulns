  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The data returned from the server in the 'data.sql_query' field is directly inserted into the HTML DOM using the .html() method. If the server-side script does not properly sanitize the 'data.sql_query' field, an attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web page, leading to XSS attacks. This vulnerability is classified as CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')."
