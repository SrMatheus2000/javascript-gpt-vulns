  "description": "The function parse_URI is vulnerable to several types of attacks. Firstly, it does not validate the input URI properly, which can lead to unexpected behavior (CWE-20). Secondly, it exposes sensitive information such as username and password in the constructed URI (CWE-200). Lastly, it does not validate the redirection URL, which can lead to redirection to untrusted sites (CWE-601)."
