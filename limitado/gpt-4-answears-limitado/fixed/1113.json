  "vulnerabilities": ["SQL Injection", "No input validation"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection because it directly uses the 'padId' in a database query without any sanitization or parameterization. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the SQL query and gain unauthorized access to data. Additionally, there is no input validation to ensure that 'padId' is of the expected format and type."
