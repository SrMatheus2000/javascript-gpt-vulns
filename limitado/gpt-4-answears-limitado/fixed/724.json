  "description": "The function uses Math.random() to generate random numbers, which is not cryptographically secure and can lead to predictable randomness (CWE-330). The function also does not limit the size of the input string, which could lead to excessive resource consumption if a very large string is passed (CWE-400). Additionally, the function does not properly validate the input 'problem_pattern' and 'method', which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors (CWE-20)."
