  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that it directly uses user input in the 'replace' function without properly sanitizing it first. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the 'replacementHash' or 'options' parameters, which would then be executed when the function is called. This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
