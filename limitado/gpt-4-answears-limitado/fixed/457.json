It checks if a text is matched and if so, it adds it to the htmlText string after escaping any HTML characters to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. If the text is not matched, it still escapes any HTML characters before adding it to the htmlText string. Therefore, no vulnerabilities are detected."
