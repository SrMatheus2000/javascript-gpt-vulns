  "description": "The function 'convertToSVG' is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it takes an input string '_str' and uses it to generate SVG without properly sanitizing the input. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through the '_str' parameter, which would then be executed when the SVG is rendered."
