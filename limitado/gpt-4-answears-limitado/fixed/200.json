  "description": "The provided JavaScript function does not appear to have any obvious vulnerabilities. It checks the type of the input value and handles it accordingly. If the value is an array, it joins the elements into a string. If the value is a plain object, it converts it into a JSON string. If the value is null or undefined, it returns an empty string. Finally, it converts the value to a string and sanitizes it before returning. The sanitize function is not provided, but assuming it properly escapes or removes dangerous characters, it should prevent injection attacks."
