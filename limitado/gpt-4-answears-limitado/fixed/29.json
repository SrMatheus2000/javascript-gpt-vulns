  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function uses the jQuery .html() method to insert content into the page. If the content is user-supplied and not properly sanitized, this can lead to XSS attacks. In this case, the function does attempt to sanitize the input using the escapeHtml function, but it's not clear how effective this function is. Additionally, the function uses the .get() method to make a request to a URL constructed using user-supplied input (_id and prop), which could potentially lead to other vulnerabilities if the server-side code does not properly handle this input."
