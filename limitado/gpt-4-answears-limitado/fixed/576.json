  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Open Redirect attacks because it does not validate the URL before passing it to the renderer.serialize function. An attacker could potentially provide a malicious URL that redirects the user to an untrusted site. Additionally, the function exposes information through error messages. In the catch block, it sends a generic 'Cannot render requested URL' message without any specific details about the error, which could potentially expose sensitive information about the system."
