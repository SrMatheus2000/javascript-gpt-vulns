  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. If an attacker provides a large sourceMapString, it can cause the application to spend a significant amount of time processing, leading to Denial of Service. This is due to the use of a potentially 'evil' regex that can cause excessive backtracking. Additionally, the function does not validate the input, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors."
