  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-78", "CWE-22"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection", "Path Traversal"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection because it uses execFileSync function with user-supplied input (inPath, tempDir, quality) without proper sanitization or validation. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to path traversal attacks because it concatenates user-supplied input (tempDir) to file paths without proper sanitization or validation. This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete files outside of the intended directory."
