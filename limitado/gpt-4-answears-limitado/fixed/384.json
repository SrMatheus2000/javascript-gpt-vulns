  "CWEs": ["CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function '_createPreviewButton' is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'href' attribute of the button is bound to the 'href' property of 'this' object, which could be manipulated to include malicious scripts. Although there is a call to 'ensureSafeUrl' function, it's not clear how this function is implemented and whether it properly sanitizes the input to prevent XSS attacks. If it doesn't, an attacker could inject a script that would be executed when the button is clicked, leading to potential security issues like session hijacking, identity theft, defacement of the website, etc."
