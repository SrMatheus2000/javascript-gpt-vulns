  "description": "The function is vulnerable to several types of attacks. Firstly, it does not validate the input URL, which can lead to attacks such as SQL Injection or Code Injection (CWE-20, CWE-89, CWE-94). Secondly, the function does not handle errors properly, which can lead to resource management errors (CWE-99). Additionally, the function uses the 'execFile' method, which can execute arbitrary commands if an attacker can control the 'dest' variable."
