  "description": "The function is vulnerable to code injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'name' variable is directly constructed from the query parameters 'callback' or 'callback_prefix' and 'load', and then used in the generation of code without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code through the query parameters, leading to potential code execution in the context of the user's browser. Additionally, the improper escaping of output can lead to XSS attacks, where an attacker can inject malicious scripts that are executed when the user visits the page."
