  "description": "The function deleteConnection is vulnerable to OS command injection. The function uses the execFile function to execute the 'nmcli' command with user-supplied input (ap.ssid) without proper sanitization or validation. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system by providing a specially crafted string as the ssid."
