  "description": "The function does not validate the 'opts' parameter. If a malicious user passes an object with unexpected properties, it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. For example, if 'opts.method' is not an array or a string, or if 'opts.url' is not a string, the function will throw an error. This could potentially be used for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Additionally, if 'opts.handler' is not a function, the function will throw an error. This could also potentially be used for a DoS attack."
