  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks due to the use of regular expressions in the 'mime.match' and 'test' methods. An attacker could provide a specially crafted payload that causes the application to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service.
