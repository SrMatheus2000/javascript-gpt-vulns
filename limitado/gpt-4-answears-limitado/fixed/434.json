  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly inserts user input (`key` and `value`) into HTML without proper sanitization. An attacker could potentially insert malicious scripts as `key` or `value`, which would then be executed in the browser of any user viewing the generated HTML. This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
