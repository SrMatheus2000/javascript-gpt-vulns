  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Denial of Service (DoS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. If an attacker sends a large number of requests with a large 'content-length' header, it could potentially exhaust system resources, causing the application to slow down or crash. This is due to the fact that the function does not have a mechanism to limit the number of incoming requests. This vulnerability is classified as CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')."
