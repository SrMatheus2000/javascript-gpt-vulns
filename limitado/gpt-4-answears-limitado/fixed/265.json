  "description": "The function getOriginOfRequest does not validate the origin and referrer from the request. This could lead to security vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The origin and referrer should be validated against a whitelist of trusted domains. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the origin or referrer is manipulated to be a javascript: pseudo-protocol, potentially leading to XSS attacks."
