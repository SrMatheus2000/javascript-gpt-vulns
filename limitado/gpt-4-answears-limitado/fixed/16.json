  "description": "The function normalizeSpacing does not sanitize the input htmlString. This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if the input is controlled by an attacker. An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the htmlString, which would then be executed when the resulting HTML is rendered in a web browser."
