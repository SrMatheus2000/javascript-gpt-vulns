  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-287: Improper Authentication", "CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Missing JWT signature verification", "Potential type confusion vulnerability"],
  "description": "The function seems to be handling JWT (JSON Web Tokens) but it doesn't seem to be verifying the signature of the JWT. This could allow an attacker to forge a JWT. Also, the function seems to be vulnerable to type confusion vulnerability as it reassigns the 'allowed_algs', 'key', and 'options' parameters without checking their types. An attacker could potentially exploit this to pass unexpected types and cause unexpected behavior."
