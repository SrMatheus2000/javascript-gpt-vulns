  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection"],
  "description": "The function 'evaluate_value' uses the 'new Function()' constructor to create a function from a string. This is dangerous as it allows for arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the input string. This is a form of code injection vulnerability."
