  "description": "The function does not validate the input 'json' which can lead to various vulnerabilities. An attacker can pass malicious data in 'json' which can lead to SQL Injection if the data is used in a SQL query. Similarly, if the data is rendered on a web page without proper sanitization, it can lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. It's recommended to always validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent such vulnerabilities."
