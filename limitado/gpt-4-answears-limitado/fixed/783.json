  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function does not validate the input 'string' and 'opts' before processing them. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the input is not as expected. For example, if 'string' is not a string or if 'opts' is not an object or a string. Moreover, the function does not handle the case where 'opts.mode' is not a key in 'slug.defaults.modes', which could lead to a TypeError. Also, the function does not validate the keys in 'opts.multicharmap', which could lead to unexpected behavior if they are not strings."
