  "vulnerabilities": ["Infinite Loop", "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "Improper Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to an infinite loop if the 'digest' function always returns true. This can lead to uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) and can cause the application to hang or crash. Additionally, there is no validation of the input parameters 'configObj' and 'envObj'. If these objects contain malicious data or are not in the expected format, it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors (CWE-20)."
