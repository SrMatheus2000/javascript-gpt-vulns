  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks. The RegExp constructor is used with user input (config.password), which can lead to catastrophic backtracking if an attacker provides a specially crafted password. This can cause the application to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service."
