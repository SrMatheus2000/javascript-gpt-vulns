  "description": "The function 'sync' is vulnerable to OS command injection. It takes an 'os' object as an argument and directly uses the 'file' and 'args' properties of the 'command' function's return value to execute a command. If an attacker can control the 'file' or 'args' values, they can execute arbitrary commands on the system. This is a serious security risk that can lead to full system compromise."
