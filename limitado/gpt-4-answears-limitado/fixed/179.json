  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it reads files directly from the filesystem without validating the input filename, which could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files. It also exposes sensitive information (CWE-200) by including potentially sensitive data in the default configuration, such as secret keys and authentication credentials. The function also exposes detailed error messages (CWE-209) that could provide an attacker with useful information. Finally, the function does not limit the size of the file it reads into memory (CWE-400), which could lead to a denial of service if an attacker provides a large file."
