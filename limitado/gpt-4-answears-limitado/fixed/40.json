  "vulnerabilities": ["Information Disclosure", "Path Traversal"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Information Disclosure as it pushes error messages to the 'projectLogMessages' array which might expose sensitive information about the system. It is also vulnerable to Path Traversal as it uses user-supplied input in 'settings.flowFile' to access file system without proper validation and sanitization, which could allow an attacker to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration and critical system files."
