  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly inserts user-controlled data ('c' and 'd' variables) into the HTML content. An attacker could manipulate these variables to inject malicious scripts, which would then be executed in the context of the victim's session. This could lead to various harmful actions, such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
