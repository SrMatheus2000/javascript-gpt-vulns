  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the use of the 'dangerouslySetInnerHTML' property, which sets the HTML directly from user input. If the 'sanitizer' function does not properly sanitize the input, malicious scripts could be injected and executed. This is related to CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'). Additionally, the function may not properly encode or escape output, related to CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output, if the 'sanitizer' function or 'parser.render' function does not properly handle special characters."
