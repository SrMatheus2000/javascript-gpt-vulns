  "description": "The function does not properly sanitize the 'key' and 'value' parameters before using them to manipulate the DOM. This could potentially lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where an attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web page, leading to various security issues such as data theft, session hijacking, defacement of the website, etc. It is recommended to always sanitize user inputs before using them in any context."
