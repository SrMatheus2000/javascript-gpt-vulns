  "vulnerabilities": ["Command Injection", "Resource Exhaustion"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection because it uses user-supplied input (stderr) in a command that is executed by the system (execFile('tail', args)). An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by manipulating the stderr input. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to resource exhaustion due to the while loop that continues until 'this.isReady' is true. If 'this.isReady' never becomes true, the loop will continue indefinitely, potentially consuming system resources and leading to a denial of service."
