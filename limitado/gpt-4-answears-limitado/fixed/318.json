  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["No input validation"],
  "description": "The function does not perform any input validation on the 'schema' and 'candidate' parameters. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the function is called with invalid or malicious input. For example, if 'schema' or 'candidate' is not an object or if 'schema.items' is not an object, the function simply returns without any error or warning. This could potentially lead to silent failures that are difficult to debug. Additionally, if 'schema.items' or 'candidate' contains properties that are not expected by the function, these properties will be processed and could lead to unexpected behavior or errors."
