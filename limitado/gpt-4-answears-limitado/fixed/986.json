  "description": "The function is vulnerable to path traversal attacks (CWE-22) because it uses user input to construct a file path without properly sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete files outside of the intended directory. The function is also vulnerable to external control of file name or path (CWE-73) because it uses user input to construct a file name without properly sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to overwrite any file on the system. Finally, the function is vulnerable to improper neutralization of special elements in output used by a downstream component (CWE-94) because it
