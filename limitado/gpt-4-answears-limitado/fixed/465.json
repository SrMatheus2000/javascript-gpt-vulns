  "description": "The function is vulnerable as it does not validate the input data. This can lead to potential SQL Injection attacks if the 'adapterSessionIds' are used in a SQL query. Also, the function does not authenticate the user before performing the logout action. An attacker can potentially logout any user by sending a request with the user's session ID."
