  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"],
  "description": "The function uses a regular expression (regex) to parse the 'dataUrl' input. If an attacker provides a specially crafted string that results in catastrophic backtracking when processed by the regex, it could cause the application to consume excessive resources, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This is known as a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability."
