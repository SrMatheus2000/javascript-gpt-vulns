  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct file paths without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to read or write files outside of the intended directories. It is also vulnerable to Code Injection (CWE-94) as it uses user input in the 'fetch' function without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Lastly, it is vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) as it does not limit the number of concurrent requests, which can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks."
