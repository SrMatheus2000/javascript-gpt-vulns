  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-provided input (productPermalink) to construct a file path without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete files outside of the intended directory. It's also vulnerable to External Control of File Name or Path (CWE-73) as it uses user-provided input (file.originalname) to construct a file path. An attacker could manipulate the file name to overwrite other files or create new files with arbitrary content. The function is also vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) as it does not limit the size of the file
