  "description": "The function does not validate or limit the size of the input 'data'. If 'data' is large, it can cause a Buffer Overflow (CWE-119) leading to potential memory corruption. Also, the function keeps pushing 'data' into 'buf' array without any limit which can lead to excessive memory usage causing a Denial of Service (CWE-400)."
