  "CWEs": ["CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function does not properly sanitize the 'token.content' input before using it to generate HTML content. If 'options.highlight' is not provided or does not return a value, 'token.content' is directly used in the HTML output after being passed to 'escapeHtml'. If 'escapeHtml' does not properly sanitize all possible malicious input, this could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities where an attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web page."
