  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection"],
  "description": "The function seems to be vulnerable to code injection attacks. The function allows the execution of methods or functions that are dynamically determined by the user input (receiver[methodName] or func). If an attacker can control the methodName or func, they can execute arbitrary code. This is a common vulnerability known as code injection."
