  "vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection", "Improper Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to code injection attacks. The user input is directly used to construct a new RegExp object without proper sanitization or validation, which can lead to code injection if the user input includes special characters used in regular expressions. Additionally, the function does not properly validate the user input before using it in the 'url.replace' method, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues."
