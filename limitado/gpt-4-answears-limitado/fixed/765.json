  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it uses the 'dangerouslySetInnerHTML' property, which is a known security risk as it can potentially insert malicious scripts into the web page. The function does attempt to escape HTML for rendering, but if the 'escapeHtmlForRender' function is not implemented correctly, it could still leave the application open to XSS attacks."
