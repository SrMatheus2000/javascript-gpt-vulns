  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it uses the innerHTML property to insert user-controlled data into the DOM. If an attacker can control the value of 'text' or 'w.config.legend.markers.customHTML', they can inject malicious scripts into the webpage, which will be executed when the page is loaded. This can lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
