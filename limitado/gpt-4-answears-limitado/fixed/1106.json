  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses the hash part of the URL (window.location.hash) without properly sanitizing it. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the URL hash, which would then be executed by the function. This could lead to various security issues, such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
