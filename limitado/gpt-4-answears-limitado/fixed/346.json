  "description": "The function sanitizePath is vulnerable to Path Traversal attacks (CWE-22). The function attempts to sanitize the 'name' parameter by removing '../' sequences, but it does not properly handle cases where these sequences are encoded. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to access arbitrary files on the system by providing a specially crafted 'name' parameter."
