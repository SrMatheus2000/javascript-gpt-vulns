  "description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the 'domains', 'path', 'format', 'publicUrl', and 'aliases' inputs. This could lead to SQL Injection if these inputs are used in a SQL query. It could also lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) if these inputs are rendered on a web page. The 'domains' input is also used to construct a URL, which could lead to URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') if it contains malicious values."
