  "vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection"],
  "description": "The function appears to be vulnerable to code injection. It takes in arguments and directly uses them to call a function without any sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code through the 'argsFn' or 'fn' parameters. The 'ensureSafeObject' and 'ensureSafeFunction' methods might mitigate this risk if they properly sanitize the input, but without their implementation details, it's impossible to be sure. The function also doesn't handle exceptions, which could lead to denial of service if an error occurs."
