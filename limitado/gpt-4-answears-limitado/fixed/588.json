  "vulnerabilities": ["JSON Injection", "Denial of Service"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to JSON Injection because it uses JSON.parse() on user-supplied data without proper validation. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JSON into the 'value' parameter, potentially leading to various types of attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Additionally, the function does not limit the size of the 'value' parameter, which could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if an attacker sends a large amount of data, causing the server to consume excessive resources while processing the data."
