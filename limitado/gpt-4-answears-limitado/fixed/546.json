  "description": "The function does not properly sanitize the 'where' parameter, which could lead to NoSQL Injection if the parameter is controlled by the user. An attacker could provide a malicious 'where' parameter that manipulates the query, leading to unauthorized access to data. The 'sanitizeFilter' function is used, but without knowing its implementation, it's hard to say if it's sufficient. Furthermore, the 'options' parameter is not sanitized at all, which could lead to potential issues if it's user-controlled."
