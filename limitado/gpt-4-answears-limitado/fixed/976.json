  "description": "The function downloadToFile is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it does not validate or sanitize the 'filename' parameter, which is used directly in fs.createWriteStream. This could allow an attacker to overwrite any file on the system. It also suffers from External Control of File Name or Path (CWE-73) for the same reason. Additionally, the function does not limit the size of the file being downloaded, which could lead to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) if an attacker is able to cause a large file to be downloaded."
