  "description": "The function 'factory' is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it takes user input and directly uses it in the creation of HTML content. Although the function 'mrk.escapeHTML' is used to escape special characters, it does not prevent all forms of XSS. For example, it does not prevent attribute-based XSS where an attacker could inject malicious code into an HTML attribute."
