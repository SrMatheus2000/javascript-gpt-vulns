  "vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection", "Improper Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to code injection attacks. The user input is directly used to construct a regular expression without any sanitization or validation. This can lead to code injection attacks where an attacker can inject malicious code as part of the input. Additionally, the function does not properly validate the user input before using it, which can lead to various types of attacks such as directory traversal, SQL injection, etc."
