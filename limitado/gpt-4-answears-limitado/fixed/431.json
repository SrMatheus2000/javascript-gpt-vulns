  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) because it uses user input to construct a file path without properly sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to access sensitive files on the server. It's also vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79) because it directly uses user input in the construction of the 'jsonFileUrl' without proper sanitization or encoding, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts."
