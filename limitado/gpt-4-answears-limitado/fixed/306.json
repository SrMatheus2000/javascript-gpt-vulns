  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution which is a type of attack where the properties of JavaScript objects can be manipulated. This can lead to a variety of security vulnerabilities such as Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, or even bypassing security checks. The vulnerability occurs because the function does not validate the 'path' parameter which can be manipulated to add or modify properties of the Object prototype. Any properties that are added or modified on the Object prototype will be present on all objects."
