  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function writeErr is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly includes user input (data.query.jsonp) in the response without proper sanitization or encoding. An attacker could exploit this by providing a malicious script as the jsonp parameter, which would then be executed in the context of the user's browser when the response is received."
