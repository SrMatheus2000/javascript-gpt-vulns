  "description": "The function does not validate the input before calling the getWidgetValueAsString function, which could lead to unexpected behavior if null or undefined is passed. Additionally, the function does not validate the input before calling JSON.stringify, which could lead to a SyntaxError if the input is not properly formatted. Finally, the function does not sanitize the output of value.toString(), which could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the value contains malicious scripts."
