  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function does not properly sanitize the input text when the tag is either 'script' or 'style'. This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where an attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web page. This is particularly dangerous as it could lead to various harmful actions such as stealing user data, spreading malware, defacing websites, etc. It is recommended to always sanitize user input, regardless of the tag type, to prevent such vulnerabilities."
