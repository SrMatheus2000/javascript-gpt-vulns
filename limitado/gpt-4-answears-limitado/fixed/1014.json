It checks the type of the input, converts it to a string if necessary, and then sanitizes it by replacing certain characters with their HTML entity equivalents. This helps prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by ensuring that any potentially harmful characters are not interpreted as code. There are no apparent vulnerabilities or CWEs (Common Weakness Enumerations) in this function."
