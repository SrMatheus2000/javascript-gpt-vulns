  "description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection. The 'indexName' parameter is directly used in SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterized query, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. Also, the 'i.columns' is directly concatenated into the SQL query, which could also lead to SQL Injection if the 'i.columns' is user-controlled and not properly sanitized."
