  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input to set the innerHTML property of an element. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts by manipulating the 'text' variable, which would then be executed in the context of the user's browser when the page is rendered."
