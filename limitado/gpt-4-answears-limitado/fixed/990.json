  "description": "The function uses a cryptographic algorithm that may not be strong enough to properly secure the data it is intended to protect. The function also uses a potentially predictable random value, which can lead to vulnerabilities if the value is used in a security-sensitive context. Additionally, the function does not appear to encrypt sensitive data before storing it, which could expose the data to unauthorized access."
