  "description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection. The 'files', 'message', and 'tagName' parameters are directly used in the 'cp.exec' function which executes shell commands. If an attacker can control the value of these parameters, they can inject arbitrary commands to be executed on the server. This can lead to serious security issues like data leakage, data manipulation, or even full system control. The 'escapeQuotes' function is not enough to prevent command injection, as other special characters can still be used to break out of the intended command."
