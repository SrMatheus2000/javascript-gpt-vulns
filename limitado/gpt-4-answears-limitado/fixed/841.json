  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input in file paths without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access arbitrary files on the system by providing a malicious file path. Additionally, the function may expose sensitive information (CWE-200) through error messages or logs, which could be exploited by an attacker to gain more information about the system."
