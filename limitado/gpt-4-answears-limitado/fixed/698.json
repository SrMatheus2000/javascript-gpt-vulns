  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output"],
  "description": "The function does not properly sanitize or escape the output, which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. For example, in the 'postJson' method, user-supplied input is directly included in the form without any sanitization or encoding. An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed when the form is submitted. Similarly, in the 'setElementName' method, the 'name' attribute of an element is directly set to a user-supplied value without any sanitization or encoding. This can also lead to XSS vulnerabilities."
