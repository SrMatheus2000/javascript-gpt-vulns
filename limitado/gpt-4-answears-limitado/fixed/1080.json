  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input (from a textarea or other form elements) and inserts it into the HTML DOM using the .html() and .text() methods. An attacker could potentially insert malicious scripts through these inputs, which would then be executed in the browser of any user viewing the page."
