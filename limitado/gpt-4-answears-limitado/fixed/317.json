  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input in file paths without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to access arbitrary files. It is also vulnerable to Command Injection (CWE-78) and Code Injection (CWE-94) as it uses user-supplied input in commands and code without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands or code. Additionally, it is vulnerable to Information Exposure Through an Error Message (CWE-209) as it may reveal sensitive information in error messages."
