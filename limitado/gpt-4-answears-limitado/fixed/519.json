  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to access files (filename is derived from request.url). An attacker could manipulate the path to access sensitive files outside of the intended directory. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Information Exposure (CWE-200) as it reveals system-level details in error messages (response.end(err + \"\\n\")). This could provide an attacker with valuable information about the system."
