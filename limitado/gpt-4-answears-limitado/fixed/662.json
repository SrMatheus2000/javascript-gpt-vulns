  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Callback Hell", "Error Handling", "Information Exposure"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable due to the improper handling of errors and the potential for callback hell. The function does not validate the input for the 'cb' parameter, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Additionally, the function returns the error object directly to the callback function, which could expose sensitive information. The function also nests multiple callbacks, which can lead to 'callback hell' and make the code difficult to understand and maintain."
