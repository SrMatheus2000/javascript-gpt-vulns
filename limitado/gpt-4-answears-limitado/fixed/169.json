  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that the 'slot' variable, which is derived from 'params.content', is directly injected into the template of 'CustomSlot' without any sanitization or encoding. If 'params.content' contains malicious scripts, they will be executed when the component is rendered."
