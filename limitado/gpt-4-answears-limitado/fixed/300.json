  "description": "The function seems to be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function takes an input (node.content) and directly uses it in the output without proper sanitization or encoding. If an attacker can control the 'node.content' value, they could inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the context of the user's browser. This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
