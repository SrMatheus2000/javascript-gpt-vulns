  "description": "The provided JavaScript function does not appear to have any obvious vulnerabilities. It properly checks for configuration file existence and validates the driver selection. It does not seem to have any injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or other common web vulnerabilities. However, without the context of the rest of the application, it's impossible to say for certain. It's recommended to always follow best practices for secure coding and to regularly perform security audits on your codebase."
