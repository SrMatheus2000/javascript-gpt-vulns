  "description": "The function is vulnerable to CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) and CWE-116 (Improper Handling of Exceptions). The function blindly parses the 'value' parameter using JSON.parse without validating the input. This can lead to various security issues such as code injection, denial of service, or information disclosure. Additionally, the catch block is empty, which means any exceptions thrown during the parsing process will be silently ignored, potentially hiding critical errors or vulnerabilities."
