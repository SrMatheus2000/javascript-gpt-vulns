  "description": "The function is vulnerable to type confusion and insecure cryptographic storage. The function does not properly validate the type of the 'val' and 'secret' parameters, which can lead to type confusion vulnerabilities. Additionally, the function uses the insecure cryptographic storage method by comparing the SHA1 hash of 'mac' and 'val', which can be exploited by attackers."
