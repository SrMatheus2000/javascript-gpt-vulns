  "description": "The growl function is vulnerable to command injection and path traversal attacks. The options.exec parameter is directly used to construct a command without proper input validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. Additionally, the options.image parameter is used to construct a file path without proper input validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to traverse the file system and potentially access sensitive files."
