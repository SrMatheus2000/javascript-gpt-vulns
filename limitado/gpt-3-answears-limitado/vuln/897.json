  "description": "The function is vulnerable to CWE-319, which is Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output. The API key is being encoded using the 'base64' method, which is not sufficient for protecting sensitive information. Base64 encoding is a reversible process and can be easily decoded by an attacker. It is recommended to use stronger encryption methods, such as hashing or encryption algorithms, to protect sensitive data like API keys."
