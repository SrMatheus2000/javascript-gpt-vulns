  "description": "The provided JavaScript function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function uses the 'ipcRenderer.sendSync' method to send 'message' and 'title' parameters to the 'ELECTRON_BROWSER_WINDOW_CONFIRM' channel without proper input validation or sanitization. An attacker can potentially inject malicious code into the 'message' or 'title' parameters, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the Electron application."
