  "description": "The provided JavaScript function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function takes an 'input' parameter and performs string checks to determine if it contains specific data types such as images, audio, video, or objects. However, it does not properly sanitize or validate the 'input' parameter before using it to modify the DOM. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the page, leading to XSS vulnerabilities."
