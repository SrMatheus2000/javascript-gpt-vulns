  "description": "The 'prepare' function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Eval Injection attacks. The '_html' parameter is directly appended to the 'tooltip_div' element without proper sanitization or encoding, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code. Additionally, the function uses 'eval' to dynamically evaluate code, which can lead to code injection vulnerabilities."
