  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-470"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Improper Null Termination"],
  "description": "The code does not check if the 'linkStr' variable is defined before assigning it to the 'link' property of the 'vertices[id]' object. This can lead to an improper null termination vulnerability, where an attacker can manipulate the 'linkStr' variable to cause unexpected behavior or potential security issues."
