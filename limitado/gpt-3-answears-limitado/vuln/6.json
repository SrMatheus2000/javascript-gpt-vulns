  "description": "The provided JavaScript function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function uses a regular expression to replace any occurrences of SVG tags in the input string with an empty string. However, this regex pattern is not sufficient to prevent XSS attacks as it does not properly sanitize the input. An attacker can craft a malicious SVG tag that includes JavaScript code, which will be executed when the function is called. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code or the theft of sensitive information."
