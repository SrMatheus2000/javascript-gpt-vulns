  "description": "The code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. The 'escapeFn' function is not defined in the provided code snippet, but assuming it is used to escape user input, it may not be sufficient to prevent XSS attacks. The 'escapeFn' function should use proper encoding techniques, such as HTML entity encoding or output encoding, to ensure that user input is properly sanitized before being included in the 'args' array."
