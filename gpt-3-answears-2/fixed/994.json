  "description": "The code is vulnerable to command injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'createRequest' function does not properly sanitize user input before using it to construct a request object, which can lead to command injection. Additionally, the 'forwardResponse' function does not properly sanitize user input before sending it as a response, which can lead to XSS attacks."
