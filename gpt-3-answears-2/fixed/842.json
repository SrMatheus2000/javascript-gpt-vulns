  "description": "The growl function is vulnerable to command injection and path manipulation attacks. The options.exec parameter is directly used to construct a command without proper sanitization or validation, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. Additionally, the options.image parameter is used to construct a file path without proper validation, allowing an attacker to manipulate the path and potentially access or overwrite sensitive files."
