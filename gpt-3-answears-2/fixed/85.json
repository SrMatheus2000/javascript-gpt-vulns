  "vulnerabilities": ["Command Injection", "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection and improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command. The 'range' parameter is directly used in the 'execFile' function without proper input validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands. This can lead to remote code execution or unauthorized access to the underlying operating system."
