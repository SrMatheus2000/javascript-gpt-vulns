  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-79"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. The 'args' variable is not defined, so the 'push' method will throw an error. However, if 'args' is defined outside the function, an attacker can manipulate the 'val' parameter to inject malicious scripts into the 'args' array, leading to XSS vulnerabilities."
