  "": "The given JavaScript function is vulnerable to code injection (CWE-94) and cross-site scripting (XSS) (CWE-116) attacks. The function uses the 'new Function()' constructor to dynamically create a function from a template string. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the template, leading to code execution or XSS attacks."
