  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object References (CWE-400) because it constructs a URL using user-controlled input (the 'platform' variable) without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker could manipulate the 'platform' variable to download arbitrary files from a different location. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Command Injection (CWE-601) because it constructs a command string using user-controlled input (the 'tempFile' variable) without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker could manipulate the 'tempFile' variable to execute arbitrary commands on the system."
