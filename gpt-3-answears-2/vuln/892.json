 "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-120"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Buffer Overflow"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. It copies data from the 'this._buffer' object into the 'response' buffer without performing any bounds checking. An attacker could provide a length value that exceeds the size of the 'this._buffer' object, leading to a buffer overflow and potential code execution."
