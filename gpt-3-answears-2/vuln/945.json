  "description": "The growl function is vulnerable to command injection and path manipulation attacks. The options.exec parameter is directly used in constructing the cmd object without proper input validation or sanitization, which can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. Additionally, the image parameter is used to construct the flag and args variables without proper input validation or sanitization, which can allow an attacker to manipulate the path and potentially access or overwrite sensitive files."
