  "description": "The merge function is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object References (CWE-703) and Unvalidated Input (CWE-561) vulnerabilities. The function blindly merges the properties of object b into object a without any validation or sanitization. This can lead to security issues such as unauthorized access to sensitive data or potential injection attacks."
