  "description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection (CWE-78) and path traversal (CWE-20) attacks. The 'e' function takes user-controlled input ('c.path') and executes it as code without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands. Additionally, the function does not properly validate the 'path' property, allowing an attacker to traverse the file system and access sensitive files."
