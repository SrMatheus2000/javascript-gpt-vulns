  "description": "The function _setNestedProperty is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to modify the prototype of a JavaScript object, which can lead to an alteration in the behaviour of the object. This can lead to serious security issues like Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or even lead to other vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). In this function, the input is not properly validated, which allows an attacker to modify the prototype of an object."
