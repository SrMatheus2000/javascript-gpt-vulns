  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it takes an HTML string as input and directly injects it into the DOM without properly sanitizing it. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts in the HTML string, which would then be executed when the HTML is rendered in the browser."
