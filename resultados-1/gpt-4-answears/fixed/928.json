  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function does not properly sanitize the 'key' and 'value' parameters before using them to manipulate the DOM. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute arbitrary scripts in the victim's browser, which can lead to various attacks such as stealing sensitive information, performing actions on behalf of the user, or defacing the web page."
