  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly appends the '_html' input to the 'tooltip_div' without any sanitization or encoding when '_isHtml' is true. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through the '_html' parameter, which will be executed when the tooltip is displayed."
