  "description": "The function 'setUser' is vulnerable as it sets the user to the owner of the prefix folder without checking if the user has the correct permissions. This could potentially allow an unauthorized user to gain access to the folder. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege. The function also does not handle errors properly, which could lead to unexpected behavior."
