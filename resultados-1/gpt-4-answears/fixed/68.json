  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the use of innerHTML property in the function which allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through the 'text' variable which is directly used in innerHTML. This can lead to various attacks such as stealing sensitive information, session hijacking, defacement of the website, etc."
