  "description": "The function setupPostMessage() is vulnerable to code injection and potentially Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function listens for 'message' events and directly parses the event data as JSON without any validation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code by sending a crafted 'message' event. The function also directly invokes methods on the Reveal object based on the parsed data, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the 'method' property of the parsed data. The function does have a blacklist for certain methods, but this is not a robust security measure as it can be bypassed if the attacker knows a method name that is not on the blacklist."
