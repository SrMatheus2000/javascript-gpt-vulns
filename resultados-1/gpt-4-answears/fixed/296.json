  "description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection. The 'repo' object properties (repo.organization, repo.name, repo.branch, repo.commit) are used in the formation of a command string that is then executed. If an attacker can control the values of these properties, they can inject arbitrary commands to be executed on the system."
