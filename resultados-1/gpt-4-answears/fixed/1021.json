  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function 'unique_name_600' is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The data parameter is directly used as input for the jQuery text() function without any sanitization or encoding. This means that if an attacker can control the value of 'data', they can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the user's browser. This can lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
