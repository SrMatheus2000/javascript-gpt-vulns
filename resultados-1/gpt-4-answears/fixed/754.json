  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Potential Denial of Service (DoS)"],
  "description": "The function sets the maximum number of listeners for the 'stream' event emitter to 1000 with 'this.stream.setMaxListeners(1000)'. This could potentially lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if an attacker is able to continuously trigger the 'stream' event, as it could exhaust system resources. It's recommended to carefully manage and limit the number of event listeners in Node.js applications to prevent such vulnerabilities."
