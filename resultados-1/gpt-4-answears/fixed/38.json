  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it reads files from the local filesystem without validating or sanitizing the input 'url.pathname'. This could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system. It is also vulnerable to SQL Injection (CWE-89) and OS Command Injection (CWE-78) as it constructs a command string with unsanitized input 'data' and 'options' and executes it. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands or SQL queries."
