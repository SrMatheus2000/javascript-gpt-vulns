  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function 'unique_name_599' is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses the 'data' parameter to set the text of an HTML element without properly sanitizing it. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts by providing specially crafted 'data' that includes script tags."
