  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to access files without proper validation. It's also vulnerable to OS Command Injection (CWE-78) as it uses user input to form a command that is executed by the system. The function exposes sensitive information like AWS keys and secrets (CWE-200) and error details (CWE-209). It also does not control the size of the file being read into memory (CWE-400), which can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack."
