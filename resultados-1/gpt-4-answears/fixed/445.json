  "description": "The function is vulnerable to path traversal attacks (CWE-22) because it constructs a file path using user-supplied input without properly validating or sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete files outside of the intended directory. The function also fails to properly handle null bytes (CWE-20), which could lead to undefined behavior or other security issues."
