  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct a file path without properly validating or sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to access sensitive files outside of the intended directory. It also exposes sensitive information (CWE-200) by revealing the internal path structure of the server. Additionally, it exposes detailed error messages (CWE-209) to the client, which could provide useful information to an attacker."
