  "description": "The function 'unique_name_335' is vulnerable as it allows the creation of a server without HTTPS, which can lead to Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319). This means that the data transmitted over the network can be intercepted and read by unauthorized individuals. Additionally, the function exposes potentially sensitive information through error messages (CWE-200). When a WebSocket connection error occurs, the error details are sent to the client, which could potentially expose sensitive system or application details to an attacker."
