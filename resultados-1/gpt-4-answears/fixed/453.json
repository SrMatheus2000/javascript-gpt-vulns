  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input to update the DOM without properly sanitizing it. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through the 'data' parameter, which will then be executed in the user's browser. This can lead to various harmful actions such as stealing sensitive information, performing actions on behalf of the user, or delivering malware."
