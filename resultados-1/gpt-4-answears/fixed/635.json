  "vulnerabilities": ["Command Injection"],
  "description": "The function unique_name_350 uses the execFile function to execute the 'ifconfig' command with user-supplied input (iface). This can lead to command injection if the user-supplied input is not properly sanitized. An attacker could provide a malicious input that includes command line syntax, which could lead to arbitrary command execution."
