  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function unique_name_91 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that it directly injects the 'slot' variable into the template of a Vue component without properly sanitizing it. If the 'slot' variable contains malicious scripts, they will be executed when the component is rendered. This can lead to various security issues such as session hijacking, identity theft, defacement of the website, and other malicious activities."
