  "description": "The function unique_name_686 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that it directly uses the 'path_part' parameter to create a new URL and text for a link without properly sanitizing it. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through the 'path_part' parameter, which would then be executed when the link is clicked."
