  "description": "The function 'unique_name_491' is vulnerable due to the use of insecure cryptographic algorithm. The function uses the 'deriveBits' method which may not provide a secure implementation of the cryptographic algorithm. Additionally, the function exposes sensitive information such as private and public keys which can lead to privacy violation."
