  "description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection and Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to improper input validation. The function does not properly sanitize the 'value' variable before using it to construct a path. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts or SQL commands through the 'value' variable, leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of data. Additionally, the function does not validate or sanitize the 'parts' input, which could lead to path traversal vulnerabilities if an attacker can control the 'parts' input."
