  "description": "The function unique_name_601 does not validate the 'options' parameter properly. It assumes that 'options' is an object, which could lead to a type error if a different data type is passed. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. Additionally, the function throws error messages that could expose sensitive information about the system, such as the requirement for 'server' or 'socket' to be passed in 'options', or 'options.auth' to be a function. This could potentially provide an attacker with valuable information."
