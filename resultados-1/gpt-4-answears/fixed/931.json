  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function 'unique_name_528' is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it uses the 'escapeTextForBrowser' function to sanitize the 'rootID' and 'this.props.text' inputs before inserting them into the HTML string. If the 'escapeTextForBrowser' function is not implemented correctly, it could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, leading to XSS attacks. This vulnerability is classified as CWE-79."
