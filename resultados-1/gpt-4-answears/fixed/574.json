  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function uses the jQuery $() function to create HTML elements from user-controlled input (tabId, options.name, options.content, options.dropdown). Although the function attempts to sanitize the tabId and options.name inputs, it does not sanitize the options.content and options.dropdown inputs. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through these inputs, which would then be executed when the resulting HTML is rendered in a user's browser."
