  "description": "The function 'unique_name_173' is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that the 'author' parameter is not properly sanitized before being inserted into the HTML code. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts by providing an 'author' value containing script tags. This could lead to various security issues such as stealing sensitive information, performing actions on behalf of the user, or spreading malware."
