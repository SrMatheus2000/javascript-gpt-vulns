  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input in file paths without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files. It is also vulnerable to OS Command Injection (CWE-78) as it uses user-supplied input in OS commands without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. Code Injection (CWE-94) is possible as the function uses user-supplied input in code without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Information Exposure Through an Error Message (CWE-209) is possible as the function may reveal sensitive information in error messages."
