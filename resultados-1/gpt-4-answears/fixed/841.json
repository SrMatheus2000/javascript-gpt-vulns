  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input in file paths without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access, read, or modify files outside of the intended directory. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Information Exposure (CWE-200) as it reveals detailed error messages that could provide an attacker with useful information about the system."
