  "description": "The function 'factory' is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it takes user input and directly uses it to generate HTML without properly sanitizing it. An attacker could inject malicious scripts through the 'patterns', 'extendPatterns', 'pairs', 'extendPairs', 'htmlify', and 'extendHtmlify' parameters, which could then be executed in the context of the user's browser. This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
