  "vulnerabilities": ["Insecure Default Initialization", "Insecure Randomness"],
  "description": "The function createPrivateKey is vulnerable due to the following reasons: \n\n1. Insecure Default Initialization: The function initializes the keyBitsize to 2048 if no value is provided. This could potentially lead to weak encryption if the default value is not strong enough.\n\n2. Insecure Randomness: The function does not validate the keyBitsize input. An attacker could potentially provide a weak keyBitsize, leading to weak encryption.\n\n3. Improper Input Validation: The function does not validate the options input. An attacker could potentially provide malicious options, leading to unexpected behavior."
