  "vulnerabilities": ["Denial of Service (DoS)", "Buffer Overflow"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and Buffer Overflow. The 'Content-length' header is directly used to allocate a buffer, without any checks on its value. An attacker can send a very large number in the 'Content-length' header, causing the server to allocate a large amount of memory, potentially leading to resource exhaustion and a DoS condition. Additionally, the 'copy' function is used without checking if the chunk size exceeds the buffer size, which can lead to a Buffer Overflow."
