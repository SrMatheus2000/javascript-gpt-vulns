  "vulnerabilities": ["Command Injection"],
  "description": "The function execute() takes smbCommand and smbCommandArgs as parameters and passes them directly to the execa() function which executes the command in the shell. If an attacker can control the smbCommand or smbCommandArgs, they can execute arbitrary commands on the system. This is known as command injection vulnerability."
