  "description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection because it uses user-supplied input (ap.ssid and config.iface) in a command that is executed by the system. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by providing a specially crafted ssid or iface. Additionally, the function writes to a file using a hard-coded file name and path, which could potentially be exploited to overwrite important files or write to restricted directories. Finally, the function deletes a file using a hard-coded file name and path, which could potentially be exploited to delete important files."
