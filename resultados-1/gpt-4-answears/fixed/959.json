  "description": "The function unique_name_550 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input to create HTML elements without sanitizing the input first. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through the 'opts' object, particularly through the 'tag', 'no_data_text', and 'no_data_class' properties. This could lead to various security issues, such as data theft, session hijacking, or defacement of the website."
