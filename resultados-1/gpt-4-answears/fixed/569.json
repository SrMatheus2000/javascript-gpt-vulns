  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it uses the innerHTML property to directly insert user-controlled input (details.source, details.runtime, etc.) into the HTML document. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into these inputs, which would then be executed when the HTML is rendered by a web browser."
