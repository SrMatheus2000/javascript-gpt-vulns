  "description": "The function 'unique_name_294' is vulnerable to Path Traversal attack (CWE-22). The vulnerability exists because the function does not properly validate the 'options.path' input, which is used to construct file paths. An attacker could potentially manipulate 'options.path' to navigate outside of the intended directory, leading to unauthorized access to files. Although there is a check to prevent extraction of a file outside of the target path, it only checks if the destination starts with the intended path, not if it eventually navigates outside of it."
