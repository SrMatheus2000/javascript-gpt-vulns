  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) as it directly uses user input in the 'authorize' function without proper sanitization or encoding. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts. The function also exposes sensitive information such as 'clientId', 'auth', 'state', and 'redirectUrl' to the global 'window' object, which can lead to Information Exposure. Additionally, the function does not implement any CSRF protections, making it vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks."
