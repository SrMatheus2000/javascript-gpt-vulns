  "description": "The function unique_name_663 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function uses the escapeHtml function to sanitize the 'value' parameter, but it does not sanitize the 'key' parameter. This means that an attacker could inject malicious scripts through the 'key' parameter. Additionally, the function does not sanitize the output of the 'value' parameter after it has been modified, which could also lead to XSS attacks."
