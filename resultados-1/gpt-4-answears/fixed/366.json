  "description": "The function htmlParserImpl is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses the input 'html' to set the innerHTML property of the inertBodyElement. Even though there is an attempt to sanitize the input and prevent mXSS attacks, it may not cover all possible cases. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through the 'html' input, which would then be executed when the HTML is rendered."
