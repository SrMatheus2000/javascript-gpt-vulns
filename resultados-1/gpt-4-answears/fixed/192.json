  "description": "The function does not validate the 'opts' parameter, which can lead to Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) if the 'opts' object contains references to sensitive data. This can allow an attacker to manipulate these references to access unauthorized data (CWE-20). Additionally, the function exposes potentially sensitive information through its properties (e.g., 'clientId', 'secure', 'userstate', etc.), which can lead to privacy violations (CWE-359)."
