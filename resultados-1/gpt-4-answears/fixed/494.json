  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function unique_name_265 takes an HTML string as input and processes it to a tree structure. However, it does not sanitize the input HTML string before processing it. This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if an attacker is able to control the input HTML string. XSS attacks can lead to session hijacking, identity theft, defacement of the website, and other serious attacks."
