  "description": "The function unescapeHTML is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it takes an input string and directly uses it in the HTML without properly sanitizing it. An attacker can inject malicious scripts in the input string which will be executed when the HTML is rendered in the browser."
