  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function unique_name_88 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that it directly inserts the 'slot' variable into the template of the 'CustomSlot' component without properly sanitizing or escaping it. If the 'slot' variable contains malicious scripts, they will be executed when the component is rendered. This can lead to various security issues such as stealing sensitive data, session hijacking, and defacement of the website."
