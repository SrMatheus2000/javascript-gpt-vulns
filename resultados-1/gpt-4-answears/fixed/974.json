  "description": "The function is vulnerable to path traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct file paths without proper sanitization. It also allows external control of file name or path (CWE-73) which can lead to unauthorized file access. The function is also vulnerable to injection attacks (CWE-94) as it uses user input in a command that is executed by the system. Lastly, the function does not limit the number of redirects (CWE-400), which can lead to resource exhaustion."
