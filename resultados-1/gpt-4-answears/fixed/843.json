  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) because it uses user input to construct a file path without properly sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete files outside of the intended directory. It's also vulnerable to External Control of File Name or Path (CWE-73) because it uses user input in the 'req.url' to determine the file to be accessed. An attacker could manipulate this input to access arbitrary files. Lastly, it's vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) because it doesn't limit the number of requests a user can make, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack."
