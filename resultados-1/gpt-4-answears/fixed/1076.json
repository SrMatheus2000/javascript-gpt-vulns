  "description": "The function 'prepare' takes a parameter '_html' and directly appends it to 'tooltip_div' without any sanitization or encoding when '_isHtml' is true. This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if the '_html' parameter can be controlled by an attacker, as they could inject malicious scripts."
