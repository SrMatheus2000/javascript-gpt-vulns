  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection"],
  "description": "The function uses the eval() function, which is a potential security risk as it allows for the execution of dynamically generated code. Even though the code uses a sanitizer, it's still possible to bypass it under certain conditions. This can lead to code injection attacks where an attacker can inject malicious code that gets executed."
