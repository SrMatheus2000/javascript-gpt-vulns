  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message", "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Information Disclosure", "Denial of Service"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to information disclosure as it prints out detailed error messages which include sensitive information such as environment variables, process details, and stack traces. This could potentially expose sensitive information to an attacker. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. In the event of an error, the function enters a loop that could potentially be infinite if the 'undead' variable is set to true, consuming system resources and potentially causing the system to crash."
