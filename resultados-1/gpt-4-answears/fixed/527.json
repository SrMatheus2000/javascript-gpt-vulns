  "description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection. The function 'openssl.exec' is used to execute openssl commands, and the parameters for the command are constructed from user-supplied input ('options' object). If an attacker can control the 'options' object, they can inject arbitrary commands to be executed on the server. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, data leakage, and other serious impacts."
