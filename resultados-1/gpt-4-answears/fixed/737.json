  "CWEs": ["CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection"],
  "description": "The function unique_name_408 uses execFileSync to execute a shell command. This can lead to OS command injection if the command or its parameters are controllable by an attacker. In this case, the command and parameters are hardcoded and not controllable by an attacker, but if this pattern is used elsewhere in the code with user-supplied input, it could lead to a vulnerability."
