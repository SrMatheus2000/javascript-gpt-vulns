  "vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection"],
  "description": "The function scanWifi is vulnerable to OS command injection. The function uses the execFile function to execute the 'nmcli' command with user-supplied input (config.iface). If an attacker can control the value of config.iface, they can inject arbitrary commands to be executed on the system. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including data theft, data corruption, or denial of service."
