  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function 'convertToSVG' is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that it takes an input string '_str' and uses it to generate SVG without properly sanitizing the input. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through the '_str' parameter, which would then be executed when the SVG is rendered. This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
