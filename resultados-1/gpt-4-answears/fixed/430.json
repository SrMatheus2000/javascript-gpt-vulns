  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function 'unique_name_221' is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that user-supplied input is being directly used in HTML generation without proper sanitization. The 'escapeHTML' function is used in some places, but not consistently throughout the code. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities."
