  "vulnerabilities": ["Denial of Service (DoS)", "Prototype Pollution"],
  "description": "The function 'unique_name_48' is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) and Prototype Pollution attacks. The DoS vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not limit the size of the input 'data', which can lead to excessive resource consumption when processing large inputs. The Prototype Pollution vulnerability is due to the fact that the function does not prevent the modification of the '__proto__' property, which can allow an attacker to modify a JavaScript object prototype."
