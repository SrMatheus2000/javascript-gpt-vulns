  "description": "The function is vulnerable to path traversal attacks. The 'entry.path' and 'entry.linkpath' variables are directly influenced by user input and are not properly sanitized before being used to construct a file path. An attacker could potentially manipulate these variables to access files outside of the intended directory. This is a violation of CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')."
