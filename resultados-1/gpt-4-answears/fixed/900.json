  "CWEs": ["CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function writeErr is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly includes user input (data.query.jsonp) in the response without proper sanitization or encoding. An attacker could inject malicious scripts by manipulating the 'jsonp' query parameter, which would then be executed in the context of the victim's browser when the response is processed."
