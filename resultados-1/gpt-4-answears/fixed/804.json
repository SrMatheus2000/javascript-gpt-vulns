  "description": "The function 'unique_name_436' is vulnerable to potential Denial of Service (DoS) attacks due to uncontrolled resource consumption. The function continuously pushes data into the 'writes' and 'buf' arrays without any limit, which could lead to excessive memory usage if the input data is large or if the function is called repeatedly in a short period of time. This could potentially crash the application or the server it's running on, resulting in a DoS condition. Additionally, the function uses the 'Buffer' constructor, which is considered unsafe due to potential security and reliability issues, and is deprecated in newer versions of Node.js."
