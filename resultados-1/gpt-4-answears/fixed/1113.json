  "description": "The function 'unique_name_667' is vulnerable to SQL Injection. The 'padId' variable is directly concatenated into the SQL query without any form of sanitization or parameterization. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code through the 'padId' variable."
