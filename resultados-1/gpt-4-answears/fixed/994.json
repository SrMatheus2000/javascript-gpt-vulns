  "vulnerabilities": ["Potential Denial of Service (DoS) via large content-length", "Error messages expose information", "No validation of input URL"],
  "description": "The function 'unique_name_576' is vulnerable due to several reasons. Firstly, it creates a buffer based on the 'Content-length' header without validating the size, which can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) if a large content-length is provided (CWE-400). Secondly, it exposes potentially sensitive information through error messages (CWE-209). Lastly, it does not validate the input URL before making a request, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues (CWE-20)."
