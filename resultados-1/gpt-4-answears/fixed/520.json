  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct file paths without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to access arbitrary files. It is also vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79) as it does not properly sanitize user input before using it in the response headers. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CWE-352) as it does not implement any CSRF protection mechanism, allowing an attacker to trick a victim into making an unintended request."
