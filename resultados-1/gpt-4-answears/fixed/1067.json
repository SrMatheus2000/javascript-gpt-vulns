  "vulnerabilities": ["Prototype Pollution", "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution because it directly assigns properties from the 'options' object to the '_self.config' object without any validation. This can allow an attacker to modify the prototype of 'Object' and inject arbitrary properties into all objects. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it uses the 'MarkdownIt' library to parse markdown input without properly sanitizing it. The 'validateLink' function attempts to prevent certain protocols from being used in links, but it does not prevent all possible XSS vectors, such as HTML tags or event handlers."
