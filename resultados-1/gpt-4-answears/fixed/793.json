  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Buffer Boundaries"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Buffer Overflow"],
  "description": "The function 'unique_name_432' is vulnerable to buffer overflow. It allocates a buffer of a specified length but does not check if the length is greater than the size of the source buffer ('this._buffer'). If the length is greater than the size of the source buffer, it will result in a buffer overflow when the 'copy' operation is performed. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including potential execution of arbitrary code, which is a serious security risk."
