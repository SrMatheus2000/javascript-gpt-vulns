  "description": "The function 'doProxy' is vulnerable to several types of attacks. Firstly, it is vulnerable to information disclosure (CWE-200) as it exposes the IP address of the client in the 'x-forwarded-for' header. Secondly, it is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CWE-352) as it does not validate or sanitize the 'req.url' input, which could allow an attacker to trick a victim into making an unintended request to the web application. Lastly, it is vulnerable to Open Redirect (CWE-601) as it does not validate or sanitize the 'remoteUrlString' input, which could allow an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary website."
