  "description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection. The function `gitane().run` is used to execute a shell command, and the command string is constructed using user-supplied input (`gitUrl(config)[0]`). An attacker could potentially control the `config` object to inject malicious commands, which would then be executed on the server. This could lead to arbitrary command execution on the server, leading to a serious security breach."
