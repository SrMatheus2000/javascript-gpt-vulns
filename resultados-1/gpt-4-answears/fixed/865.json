  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Lack of input validation", "Potential null pointer dereference"],
  "description": "The function does not validate the input 'postObj' and directly uses its properties. This can lead to unexpected behavior if 'postObj' is not in the expected format or is null. For example, if 'postObj' is null, the function will throw a TypeError when trying to access 'postObj.deleted'. Similarly, 'results' is used without any null check or existence check which can lead to null pointer dereference if 'results' is not defined. Also, 'uid' is used without being defined in the function scope which can lead to ReferenceError."
