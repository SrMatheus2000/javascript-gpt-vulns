  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-200: Information Exposure", "CWE-384: Session Fixation", "CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Session ID is not regenerated after login", "Session expiration is not properly handled", "Sensitive information is stored in session"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable as it does not regenerate the session ID after login, which can lead to session fixation attacks. Additionally, the session expiration is not properly handled, which can lead to unauthorized access if the session ID is compromised. Lastly, sensitive information (privileged status) is stored in the session, which can be exposed if the session ID is compromised."
