It uses 'strict' mode, which can help catch common coding mistakes and unsafe actions. The function also appears to properly escape and unescape HTML entities, which can help prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. However, without knowing the context in which this function is used, it's impossible to guarantee that it's completely secure."
