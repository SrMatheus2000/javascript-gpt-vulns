  "description": "The function checkCertificate is vulnerable to several types of attacks. First, it does not validate the input for 'certificate' and 'passphrase', which can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues. Second, the function uses the 'certificate' and 'passphrase' inputs directly in a command that is passed to the openssl.spawnWrapper function, which can lead to command injection if an attacker can control these inputs. Finally, if the 'certificate' input is used in a SQL query, it could lead to SQL injection if not properly sanitized."
