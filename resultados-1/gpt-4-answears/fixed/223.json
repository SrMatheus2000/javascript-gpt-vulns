  "description": "The function calculateWidthForText is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly assigns the input 'text' to the 'textContent' property of an HTML element without sanitizing the input. If the input 'text' contains malicious scripts, they will be executed when the element is rendered in the browser."
