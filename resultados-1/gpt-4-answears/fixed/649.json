  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "Prototype Pollution"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it uses the decode function without validating the input. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution because it does not prevent the addition of properties to the object prototype. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the behavior of all objects."
