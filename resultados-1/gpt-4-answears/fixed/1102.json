  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function uses jQuery's .html() method to set the HTML content of an element. This method does not escape or sanitize the input, so if the input includes script tags, they will be executed when the HTML is rendered. This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where an attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing user data or performing actions on behalf of the user."
