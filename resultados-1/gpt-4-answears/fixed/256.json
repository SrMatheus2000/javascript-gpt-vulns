  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly inserts user-controlled input (the 'data-vimeo' and 'data-vimeoparams' attributes) into HTML content (the 'src' attribute of the 'iframe' element). An attacker could potentially manipulate these attributes to inject malicious scripts, which would then be executed in the context of the user's browser session. This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as session hijacking, identity theft, or defacement of the website."
