  "vulnerabilities": ["Prototype Pollution", "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution as it allows the modification of a prototype object if the input string contains '__proto__'. This can lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution. Also, the function uses the decodeURIComponent function which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the input is not properly sanitized. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through the input string."
