  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Request Forgery", "Improper Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) as it does not implement any CSRF protection mechanism. It also suffers from Improper Input Validation as it does not validate the 'origin' and 'allowOrigins' parameters before using them. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user or to inject malicious input to manipulate the application's behavior."
