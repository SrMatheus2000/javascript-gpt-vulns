  "description": "The function does not validate the input for 'keys' and 'value', which can lead to unexpected behavior or code injection. The 'sanitizeKey' function is used, but it's not shown in the provided code, so it's unclear if it properly sanitizes the input. If it doesn't, this could lead to a code injection vulnerability. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where 'keys' is not an array, which could lead to a TypeError."
