  "description": "The function is vulnerable to information exposure through error messages as it logs sensitive information such as the absence of SERVE_USER and SERVE_PASSWORD environment variables. This could potentially expose sensitive information to an attacker. Additionally, the function does not properly limit or sanitize the pathname, which could allow an attacker to traverse the file system outside of the restricted directory. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or functionality."
