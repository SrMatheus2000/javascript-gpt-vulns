  "isVulnerable": true,

  "vulnerabilities": ["Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)", "Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID) as it directly modifies the target object without checking if it's immutable or not. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the target object is assumed to be immutable elsewhere in the code. Additionally, the function does not validate the input objects in the rest parameter, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the objects contain malicious data. The function also relies on the 'isValidKey' and 'mixin' functions, which are not provided, so potential vulnerabilities in those functions could also affect this function."
