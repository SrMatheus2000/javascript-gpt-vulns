  "description": "The function seems to be vulnerable to code injection attacks. It dynamically executes code using the 'eval' function. This can allow an attacker to run arbitrary JavaScript code, leading to a variety of attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), data theft, or even remote code execution. It's recommended to avoid using 'eval' or similar functions that execute code dynamically."
