  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input in file paths without properly validating or sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to access, read, or modify files outside of the intended directory. The function is also vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79) as it includes user-supplied data in HTTP responses without proper validation or escaping, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts."
