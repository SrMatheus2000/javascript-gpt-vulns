  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The data object properties are directly inserted into the HTML without proper sanitization or encoding, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts. The malicious script is executed when the HTML is rendered in a web browser. This can lead to various attacks such as stealing sensitive information, session hijacking, defacement of the website, etc."
