  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function does not properly sanitize the input for the 'key' and 'value' parameters. This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if the function is used to generate web pages based on user input. An attacker could inject malicious scripts through these parameters, which would then be executed in the context of the user's browser when the generated page is viewed. This could lead to various harmful actions, such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
