  "description": "The function readPkcs12 is vulnerable as it creates temporary files to store sensitive information such as passwords. This can lead to Insufficiently Protected Credentials (CWE-522) as an attacker can potentially access these temporary files and retrieve the sensitive information. Additionally, the function may also expose sensitive information during its execution (CWE-200), as it does not adequately protect the confidentiality of the data."
