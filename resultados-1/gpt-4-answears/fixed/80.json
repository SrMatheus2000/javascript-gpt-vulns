  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input in the 'url.resolve' function without proper sanitization or validation. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through the 'e' parameter, which would then be executed in the context of the user's browser. This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
