  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct a file path without properly sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to access arbitrary files on the system. The function is also vulnerable to Information Exposure (CWE-200) as it logs sensitive information such as the request URL and method, which could potentially expose sensitive user data or system information."
