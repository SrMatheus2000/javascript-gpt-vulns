It is primarily concerned with rendering images and content in a carousel, and does not perform any dangerous operations such as eval(), does not use innerHTML, and does not seem to be susceptible to XSS attacks. However, without the full context of the surrounding code, it's impossible to say for certain that there are no vulnerabilities."
