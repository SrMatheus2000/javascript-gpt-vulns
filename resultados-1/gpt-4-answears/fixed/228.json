  "vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection", "Improper Resource Shutdown or Release", "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection because it uses child_process.execFileSync() with user-supplied input (command and args) without proper sanitization or validation. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. Additionally, the function does not properly handle the release of resources in case of an error, which could lead to resource exhaustion. Finally, the function does not limit the amount of resources it can consume, which could lead to a denial of service if an attacker supplies a large amount of data."
