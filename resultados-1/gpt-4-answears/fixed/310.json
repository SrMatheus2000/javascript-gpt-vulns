  "description": "The function does not validate the input passed to the 'findFreePort' function, which could lead to improper input validation (CWE-20). This could potentially allow an attacker to pass malicious input, leading to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function does not limit the number of worker processes that can be created (CWE-400). This could potentially allow an attacker to exhaust system resources, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition."
