  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function 'unique_name_110' is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input to create new elements and set their text content. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts by providing specially crafted input. This script would then be executed when the page is rendered, leading to various types of attacks such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
