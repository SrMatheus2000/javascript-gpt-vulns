  "description": "The function does not properly validate the input for null or undefined values. This can lead to a Null Pointer Dereference when the function tries to access properties of null or undefined values. Additionally, the function does not validate the type of the callback function 'cb', which can lead to unexpected behavior if a non-function value is passed."
