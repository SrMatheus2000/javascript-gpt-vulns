  "CWEs": ["CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Command Injection"],
  "description": "The function 'execTag' is vulnerable to command injection. This is because it constructs a command string using user-supplied input (args.prerelease) and then executes this command. An attacker could provide malicious input that alters the command to be executed, leading to arbitrary command execution."
