  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'val' parameter is directly used to set the innerHTML of an element. Although there is a check for DOMPurify and if it exists, it sanitizes the 'val' input, if DOMPurify does not exist or fails for any reason, the 'val' input is directly used without any sanitization. This can lead to XSS attacks if an attacker can control the 'val' parameter."
