  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct a filesystem path without properly neutralizing special elements. This could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server. It's also vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) as it reads files synchronously which could block the event loop if the file is large. Lastly, it's vulnerable to Information Exposure Through an Error Message (CWE-209) as it directly sends the error message to the client which could leak sensitive server information."
