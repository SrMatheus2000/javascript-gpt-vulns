  "vulnerabilities": ["Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "Improper Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) because it fetches a URL provided in the request without validating or restricting which URLs can be accessed. This could allow an attacker to make requests to internal resources that the server can access but should not be exposed. Additionally, the function does not properly validate the input, which could lead to other types of attacks."
