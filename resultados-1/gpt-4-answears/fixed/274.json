  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) and OS Command Injection (CWE-78). The 'path' variable is directly used to access the file system without any sanitization or validation, which could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system. Additionally, the 'path' variable is used in a command that is executed by the system, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system."
