  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "Improper Input Validation", "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it directly injects user-controlled data into HTML without proper sanitization or output encoding, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser. It also lacks proper input validation, which can lead to other types of attacks. Furthermore, the function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) because it does not verify whether the requested action is intentional by the user, allowing an attacker to trick a user into performing actions without their consent."
