  "vulnerabilities": ["Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)", "Injection Attacks"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks due to the use of regular expressions in the 'mime.match' and '/^application\\/(?:.+\\+)?json$/.test(mime)' statements. An attacker could provide a specially crafted payload that causes the regular expression to take a very long time to evaluate, effectively causing a denial of service. Additionally, the function may be vulnerable to injection attacks, as it does not appear to sanitize the 'payload' input before using it in the 'internals.jsonParse' and 'parse' functions. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the 'payload' input, which could then be executed by the server."
