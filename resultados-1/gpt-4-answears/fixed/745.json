  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Denial of Service (DoS)", "Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function does not validate the 'opts' parameter which can lead to potential Denial of Service (DoS) attacks if an attacker provides a large array for 'opts.method'. This can cause the application to consume high CPU resources while processing the array. Additionally, the function does not validate the 'opts.url' or 'opts.path' which can lead to unexpected behavior if they are not properly formatted or if they contain malicious values."
