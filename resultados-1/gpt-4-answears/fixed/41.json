  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to access files without proper validation. This could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system. It also exposes detailed error messages (CWE-209) which could provide useful information to an attacker. Additionally, the function does not limit the number of resources it can use (CWE-400), which could lead to a denial of service if an attacker sends a large number of requests."
