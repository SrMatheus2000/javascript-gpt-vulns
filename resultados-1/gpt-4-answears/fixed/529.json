  "description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection because it uses user-supplied input in the 'openssl.spawnWrapper' function without proper sanitization or validation. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands to be executed on the server. Additionally, the function does not limit the size of the 'certificate' input, which could lead to resource exhaustion if an excessively large input is provided."
