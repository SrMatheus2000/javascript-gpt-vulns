  "description": "The function does not validate the input 'string' and 'opts' which can lead to unexpected behavior. If a large string is passed, it can lead to high CPU usage and memory consumption, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Also, the function does not handle the case where 'opts' is not an object, which can lead to type errors."
