  "description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the 'options' object that it receives. This can lead to various vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection if the 'options' object contains SQL commands, or Cross-site Scripting if it contains scripts. The function also does not check if the 'options' object is null or undefined, which can lead to a TypeError. Furthermore, the function does not validate the 'options.incomingSailsIOMsg.url' string, which can lead to security vulnerabilities if it contains malicious values."
