  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function uses the 'element.html()' method to insert user-controlled data into the HTML document. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, which will be executed in the context of the victim's session. This can lead to session hijacking, identity theft, defacement of the website, and other attacks. The function attempts to sanitize the input by removing 'script' tags, but this is not sufficient to prevent all forms of XSS. For example, an attacker could inject an event handler like 'onmouseover' to execute JavaScript without using 'script' tags."
