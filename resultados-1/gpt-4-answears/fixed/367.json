  "vulnerabilities": ["Infinite Loop Vulnerability"],
  "description": "The function stripCustomNsAttrs has a potential vulnerability where it can enter an infinite loop if the getNonDescendant function does not return a node that is not a descendant of the current node. This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack where the application becomes unresponsive due to the infinite loop. This is an example of CWE-20, where the function does not properly validate the input from the getNonDescendant function."
