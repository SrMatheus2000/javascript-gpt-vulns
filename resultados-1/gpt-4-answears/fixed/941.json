  "description": "The function 'unique_name_535' is vulnerable to SQL Injection. The database name 'db', 'charset', and 'collation' are directly concatenated into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. This could lead to unauthorized viewing, modification, or deletion of data in the database."
