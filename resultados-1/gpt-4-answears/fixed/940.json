  "description": "The function unique_name_534 is vulnerable to SQL Injection. The function constructs an SQL query by concatenating a user-controlled variable 'f.Field' directly into the query. An attacker could provide specially crafted input to 'f.Field' that modifies the SQL query in a way that could lead to unauthorized access, data corruption or data loss."
