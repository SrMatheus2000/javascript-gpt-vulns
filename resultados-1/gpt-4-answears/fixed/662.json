  "vulnerabilities": ["Callback Hell", "Error Handling", "Potential Information Exposure"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable due to the following reasons: Firstly, it suffers from 'Callback Hell' which makes the code hard to read and debug. Secondly, the error handling is not done properly. If an error occurs, it simply returns the error without any proper logging or handling. This can lead to information exposure as the error might contain sensitive information. Lastly, the function does not seem to properly release resources after using them. This can lead to resource leaks and can affect the performance of the application."
