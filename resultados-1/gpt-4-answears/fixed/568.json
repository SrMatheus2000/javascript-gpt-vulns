  "vulnerabilities": ["Insufficient Entropy in PRNG"],
  "description": "The function 'unique_name_309' uses 'crypto.randomBytes(1)[0]' to generate a random number, which may not provide sufficient entropy for security-related decisions. This could lead to predictability in generated values, making the system vulnerable to attacks."
