  "description": "The function is vulnerable to timing attacks. The time taken by the function to compare two strings can be used by an attacker to guess the string values. This is because the function uses the 'crypto.timingSafeEqual' method, which is designed to prevent timing attacks, but the strings are converted to buffers of equal length before the comparison, which can leak information about the length of the strings. This can be exploited in a timing attack to guess the string values."
