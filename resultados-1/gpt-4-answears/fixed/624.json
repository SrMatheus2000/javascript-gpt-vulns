  "description": "The function fetchContentType() does not validate or sanitize the input it receives. This could lead to an SQL Injection attack if the input is crafted in a certain way. For example, if the contentType or charset parameters contain SQL commands, they could be executed on the server, leading to unauthorized access or data loss. Additionally, the function does not handle errors, which could lead to unexpected behavior or application crashes."
