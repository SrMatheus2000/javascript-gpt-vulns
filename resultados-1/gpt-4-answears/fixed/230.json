  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) because it uses the 'normalize' function on an unsafe path, which can be manipulated to access files outside of the intended directory. It also exposes sensitive information through error messages (CWE-209) by including the file path and error details in the response. This can provide an attacker with valuable information about the system. Additionally, the function exposes information (CWE-200) by returning the content of the file in the response."
