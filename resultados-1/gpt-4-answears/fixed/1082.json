  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'window.parent.db' variable is directly used in the 'question' variable without proper sanitization. If an attacker can control the value of 'window.parent.db', they can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of the victim's session. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or distribution of malicious code to other users."
