  "description": "The function does not validate the input it receives. It assumes that the 'node' and 'initialScope' parameters are always valid, which may not be the case. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Additionally, the function does not handle errors or exceptions, which could lead to crashes or undefined behavior if something goes wrong. For example, if 'getStaticValueR' or 'getElementValues' throw an error, the function will not catch it and the error will propagate up the call stack."
