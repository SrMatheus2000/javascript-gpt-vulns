  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Error Handling", "Callback Function"],
  "description": "The function does not validate the input 'er' before using it. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Additionally, the error messages are directly returned without any sanitization or specific handling, which could potentially expose sensitive information. The callback function 'cb' is also not defined within the scope of the function, which could lead to ReferenceError if it's not defined in the outer scope."
