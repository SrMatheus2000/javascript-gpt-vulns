  "description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection. The 'host' parameter is passed directly to the 'Child.spawn' function without any sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands to be executed on the system. For example, if an attacker provides a 'host' value of '; rm -rf /', it would delete all files on the system. This is a critical security issue and should be addressed immediately."
