  "description": "The function unique_name_316 is vulnerable to both Code Injection and Path Traversal attacks. The function uses the 'require' function with a variable 'name' that is directly taken from the function's input. An attacker could potentially provide a malicious 'name' that could lead to execution of arbitrary code or access to restricted directories."
