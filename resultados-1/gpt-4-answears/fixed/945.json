  "description": "The function unique_name_539 is vulnerable to SQL Injection. The function constructs an SQL query by concatenating user-controlled input (indexName, i.type, i.kind, i.columns) without properly sanitizing or escaping it. An attacker could provide malicious input that alters the SQL query to perform unintended actions, such as retrieving, modifying, or deleting data."
