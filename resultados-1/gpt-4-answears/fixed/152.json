  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) because it uses user input from 'req.url' to construct a file path without proper sanitization. An attacker could manipulate 'req.url' to access files outside of the intended directory. Additionally, the function may expose sensitive information (CWE-200) by revealing the existence of files based on the server's response. For example, a different response for a file that exists but the user doesn't have access to, versus a file that doesn't exist at all, could allow an attacker to map the file system."
