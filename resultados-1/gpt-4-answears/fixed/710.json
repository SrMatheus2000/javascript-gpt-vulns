  "description": "The function does not validate its inputs, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. For example, if the 'form' parameter is not a string or an object, an error is thrown, but this is not checked until the end of the function. This could lead to injection attacks if malicious data is passed in. Additionally, the function uses recursion without any termination condition, which could lead to resource exhaustion if the 'form' parameter contains a circular reference."
