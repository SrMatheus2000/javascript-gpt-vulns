  "CWEs": ["CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function"],

  "description": "The function uses 'Math.random()' which is not cryptographically secure. It can lead to predictable randomness vulnerabilities. Also, the function uses 'Buffer.allocUnsafe(8)', which can potentially lead to the disclosure of sensitive information as it does not initialize the allocated memory."
