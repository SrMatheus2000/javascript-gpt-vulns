{
  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Potential Buffer Overflow"],
  "description": "The function uses the 'new Buffer()' constructor, which can lead to security vulnerabilities if not used properly. If the input is not properly validated, it can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. It's recommended to use 'Buffer.from()', 'Buffer.alloc()', or 'Buffer.allocUnsafe()' instead of 'new Buffer()' to increase the security of the application."
