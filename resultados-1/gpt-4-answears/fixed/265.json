  "description": "The function getOriginOfRequest does not validate the origin and referrer from the request. This could lead to security vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The function also does not validate the protocol and host parsed from the referrer, which could lead to similar vulnerabilities."
