  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the use of the .html() method in the line 'tmp = tmp.html();' and 'data.text = this.settings.core.force_text ? tmp.text() : tmp.html();'. The .html() method can execute arbitrary JavaScript code, which can lead to XSS attacks if the input is not properly sanitized. This is classified as CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')."
