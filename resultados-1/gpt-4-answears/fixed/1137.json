  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The data retrieved from $(this).data('cortex-json') is encoded with htmlEncode() function and then directly injected into the HTML DOM using the jQuery .html() method. If an attacker can control the 'cortex-json' data attribute, they can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of the victim's session. This can lead to session theft, account takeover, and other serious impacts."
