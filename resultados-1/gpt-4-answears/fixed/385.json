  "description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks. The function 'PGStore.prototype.query' takes a query string and parameters as input and executes the query. However, it does not sanitize or escape the input before executing the query, which can lead to SQL Injection attacks if an attacker can control the input. The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) for SQL Injection is CWE-89."
