  "description": "The function 'unique_name_184' is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function takes a value and returns it enclosed in square brackets, but it only removes square brackets and single quotes from the input. This means that if the input contains any script tags or other potentially harmful HTML, it will be returned as is. An attacker could use this to inject malicious scripts into the output of the function, leading to an XSS attack."
