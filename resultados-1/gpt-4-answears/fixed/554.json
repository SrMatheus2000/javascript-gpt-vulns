  "CWEs": ["CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function 'unique_name_301' is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input in the 'props.prependHTML', 'props.prepend', 'props.appendHTML', and 'props.append' properties without properly sanitizing or escaping it. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through these properties, which will then be executed in the user's browser when the page is rendered. This can lead to various harmful actions such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
