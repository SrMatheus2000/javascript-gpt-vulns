  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the use of 'document.createElement' and 'appendChild' methods which can be manipulated to inject malicious scripts into the web page. The function does not properly sanitize user inputs before inserting them into the HTML document. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser."
