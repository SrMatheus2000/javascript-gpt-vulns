  "vulnerabilities": ["Path Traversal", "Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function 'getType' is vulnerable to path traversal attacks because it does not validate or sanitize the 'path' input. An attacker could potentially manipulate the 'path' input to access sensitive files or data outside of the intended directory. Additionally, the function does not validate the input, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors."
