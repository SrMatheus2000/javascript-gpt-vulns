  "description": "The function uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML which is a known potential source of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. XSS vulnerabilities allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into webpages viewed by other users. Even though the function attempts to escape HTML before setting it, it's still a risky practice that could lead to vulnerabilities if not handled properly."
