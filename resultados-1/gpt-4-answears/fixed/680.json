  "description": "The function is vulnerable to path traversal attacks. The function does not validate or sanitize the 'pkg.path' input, which is used to construct file paths. An attacker could potentially manipulate 'pkg.path' to navigate outside of the intended directory structure, leading to unauthorized file system access."
