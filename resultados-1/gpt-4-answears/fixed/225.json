  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'sanitizer' function is used to sanitize the 'html' variable, which is derived from user input ('source'). However, the 'useUnsafeMarkdown' option from 'getConfigs()' is passed to the sanitizer. If 'useUnsafeMarkdown' is true, it may allow potentially unsafe HTML and JavaScript code to be included in the 'sanitized' variable. This code is then inserted into the page using 'dangerouslySetInnerHTML', which could lead to XSS attacks if an attacker can control the 'source' or 'getConfigs' inputs."
