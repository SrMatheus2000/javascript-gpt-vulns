  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal and OS Command Injection. The 'stderr' parameter is used directly in a file system operation without any sanitization, which could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete files (CWE-22). Additionally, the 'stderr' parameter is used in an OS command without any sanitization, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands (CWE-78)."
