  "description": "The function 'unique_name_519' is vulnerable to SQL Injection and Cross-site Scripting attacks. The function takes user input through 'socketIOData' and directly uses it to build a request object without proper sanitization or validation. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL commands or scripts, leading to potential data loss, corruption, or unauthorized access. It is recommended to use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL Injection and to sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent Cross-site Scripting."
