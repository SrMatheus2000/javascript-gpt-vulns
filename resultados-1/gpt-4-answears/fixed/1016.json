  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-328: Reversible One-Way Hash"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Insecure Cryptographic Storage"],
  "description": "The function uses SHA-1 for hashing, which is considered insecure for many cryptographic functions. SHA-1 is vulnerable to collision attacks, where two different inputs produce the same hash output. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the data and produce the same hash, bypassing the security check."
