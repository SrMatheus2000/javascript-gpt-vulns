  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly inserts user-controlled data (the 'data' parameter) into the HTML document without properly sanitizing it. An attacker could exploit this by providing malicious script content as 'data', which would then be executed when the HTML document is rendered by a web browser."
