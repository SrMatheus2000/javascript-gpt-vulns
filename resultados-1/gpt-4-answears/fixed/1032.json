  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Use of Deprecated Node.js 'Buffer' Constructor"],
  "description": "The function uses the 'new Buffer()' constructor, which is deprecated and unsafe due to security and usability issues. It can lead to several issues like buffer overflow or data exposure if the input is not properly validated. It's recommended to use 'Buffer.from()', 'Buffer.alloc()', or 'Buffer.allocUnsafe()' instead."
