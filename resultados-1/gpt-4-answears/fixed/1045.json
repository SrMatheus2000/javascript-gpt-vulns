  "description": "The function is vulnerable to path traversal and command injection attacks. The 'base' and 'git' options are taken from user input and are not properly sanitized before being used. An attacker could manipulate these inputs to traverse the file system or inject arbitrary commands. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or execution of arbitrary commands with the privileges of the application."
