  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection"],
  "description": "The function 'unique_name_35' is vulnerable to code injection. It takes a string 'str' as input and directly uses it to create a new instance of 'tree.Anonymous'. If an attacker can control the value of 'str', they can inject arbitrary code into the application, leading to serious security risks such as data leakage, data manipulation, or even remote code execution."
