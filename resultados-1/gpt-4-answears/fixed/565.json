  "description": "The function uses SHA-1 for HMAC which is considered weak and vulnerable to collision attacks. It also uses AES-256-CBC for encryption which is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. It's recommended to use a stronger hash function like SHA-256 or SHA-3 and an authenticated encryption mode like AES-GCM."
