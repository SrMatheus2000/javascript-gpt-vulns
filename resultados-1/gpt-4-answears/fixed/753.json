  "description": "The function does not validate the input 'msg' before using it to decode a proposal and create a public key. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if 'msg' is not in the expected format. It could also potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) if 'msg' contains malicious data."
