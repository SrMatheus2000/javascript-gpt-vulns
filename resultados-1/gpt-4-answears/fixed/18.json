  "description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection. The function uses the 'exec' function to execute a shell command that includes user-supplied input. If an attacker can control the 'port' parameter, they can inject arbitrary commands to be executed on the server. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including data theft, data corruption, denial of service, or even full system compromise."
