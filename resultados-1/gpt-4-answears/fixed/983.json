  "description": "The function buildDownloadUrl does not validate or sanitize the input parameters 'version' and 'minorVersion'. This could lead to a potential code injection vulnerability where an attacker could manipulate the URL to download malicious content. For example, an attacker could pass a version parameter like '2.0; rm -rf /' which could lead to arbitrary code execution."
