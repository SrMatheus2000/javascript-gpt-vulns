  "description": "The function parse_URI is vulnerable as it does not properly validate and sanitize the input URI. This could lead to various types of injection attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection, if the output is used in a context that allows for execution of injected code. Additionally, the function does not properly neutralize special elements in the output, which could be used by a downstream component in a way that allows for execution of arbitrary code or commands."
