  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) because it uses user input to construct a file path without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access arbitrary files on the server. The function is also vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79) because it directly inserts user input into the HTML content without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page."
