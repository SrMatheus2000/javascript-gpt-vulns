  "description": "The function getSizeFromRatio is vulnerable to code injection attacks. The function uses the math.eval function to evaluate a string provided in the options.ratio parameter. An attacker could potentially provide a malicious string that includes arbitrary JavaScript code, which would then be executed when the math.eval function is called."
