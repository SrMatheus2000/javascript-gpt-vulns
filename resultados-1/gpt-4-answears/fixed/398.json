  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct file paths without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access, read, or modify files outside of the intended directories. It is also vulnerable to Code Injection (CWE-94) as it uses the 'require' function with user-controlled input, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Lastly, the function is vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) as it does not limit the size of the 'routeCache' object, which could be exploited to cause a denial of service by consuming all available memory."
