  "vulnerabilities": ["JSON Injection", "Denial of Service", "Path Traversal"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to JSON Injection because it parses user-supplied input without proper validation. This can lead to arbitrary code execution. The function is also vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks because it does not limit the size of the input, which can lead to resource exhaustion. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Path Traversal attacks because it uses user-supplied input to construct file paths without proper sanitization."
