  "description": "The function appears to be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that it uses the 'sanitise' function on user-supplied input before inserting it into HTML content. If the 'sanitise' function does not properly escape all dangerous characters, an attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web page, leading to XSS attacks. This could allow the attacker to steal sensitive information, perform actions on behalf of the user, or deliver malware."
