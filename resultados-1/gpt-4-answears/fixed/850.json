  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function 'unique_name_471' is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that it does not properly sanitize the attributes of the 'currentNode' before re-assigning them. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through the attributes of the 'currentNode', which would then be executed when the node is rendered in the browser. This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
