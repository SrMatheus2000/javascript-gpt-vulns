  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function uses the innerHTML property to insert text into HTML elements. If the text is user-controlled and not properly sanitized, it can include HTML tags and JavaScript code that will be executed by the browser. This can lead to various attacks, such as stealing user's cookies or other sensitive information. The function does attempt to sanitize some of the input with the Utilities.sanitizeDom function, but it does not sanitize all of the input that is inserted into the HTML. Specifically, the xVal, xAxisTTVal, val, and zVal variables are not sanitized before being inserted into the HTML."
