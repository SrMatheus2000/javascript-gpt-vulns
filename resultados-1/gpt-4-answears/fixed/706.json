  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"],
  "description": "The function uses regular expressions (regex) to validate input. However, it does not properly handle cases where the input is not as expected. This can lead to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) where an attacker provides a specially crafted input that causes the regex to take a very long time to evaluate, effectively causing a denial of service. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the 't' object does not have the expected properties, which could lead to a TypeError."
