  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Input Validation Vulnerability"],
  "description": "The function isSafe() is vulnerable because it does not properly validate the input. It only checks for the length of the userAgent string and the ASCII value of each character. However, it does not check for special characters or malicious scripts that could be embedded in the userAgent string. This could lead to security issues such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or SQL Injection attacks."
