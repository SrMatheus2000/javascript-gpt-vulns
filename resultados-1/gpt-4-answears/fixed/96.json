  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it reads a file using a path constructed from user input without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system. It's also vulnerable to Code Injection (CWE-94) as it directly uses user input in the 'app.get' and 'app.post' methods without proper validation or sanitization, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious code. Lastly, it's vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CWE-352) as it applies CSRF middleware to some routes but not all, leaving some routes unprotected."
