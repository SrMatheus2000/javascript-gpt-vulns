  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function uses the .html() and .text() methods to insert user-controlled input into the DOM. If an attacker can control the input, they can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code, which will be executed in the context of the victim's session. This can lead to session hijacking, identity theft, defacement of the website, and other attacks."
