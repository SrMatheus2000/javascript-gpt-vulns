  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)", "JSON Injection", "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to the use of regular expressions in the 'mime.match' and 'test' methods. An attacker could provide a specially crafted payload that would cause the application to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to JSON Injection due to the use of 'Bourne.parse' without proper input validation. An attacker could inject malicious JSON data that could lead to unexpected behavior. Lastly, the function does not control the size of the payload, which could lead to uncontrolled resource consumption if an attacker provides a large payload."
