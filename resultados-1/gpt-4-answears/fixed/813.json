  "vulnerabilities": ["Buffer Overflow"],
  "description": "The function 'unique_name_445' is vulnerable to buffer overflow. This is because it does not properly check the length of the input 'addr' and 'mask' before copying them into the 'result' buffer. If the length of 'addr' or 'mask' is greater than the length of 'result', it can lead to a buffer overflow, which can cause the program to crash or potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code."
