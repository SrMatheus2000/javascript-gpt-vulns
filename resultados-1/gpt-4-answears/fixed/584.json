  "CWEs": ["CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Prototype Pollution"],
  "description": "The function 'unique_name_318' is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. This is because it does not prevent the modification of the Object prototype. An attacker can manipulate these attributes to override, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values. This can lead to a variety of application-level vulnerabilities such as Denial of Service, Remote Code Execution, or even bypassing security checks."
