  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function creates a new div element and sets its text content to the value of the 'row' variable, which is derived from the 'array' parameter of the 'refresh' function. If an attacker can control the value of items in this array, they could inject malicious scripts that would be executed when the div element is rendered in the browser. This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
