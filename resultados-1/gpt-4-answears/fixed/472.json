  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input to construct file paths without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete files outside of the intended directories. It is also vulnerable to SQL Injection (CWE-89) and Code Injection (CWE-94) as it uses user-supplied input in SQL queries and code execution without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries or code, leading to data loss, corruption, or unauthorized access. Lastly, it is vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) as it does not limit the number of resources that can be consumed when handling requests, potentially leading to a denial of service."
