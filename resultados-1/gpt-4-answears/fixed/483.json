  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function 'unique_name_255' is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it uses the 'innerHTML' property to insert user-controlled data into the DOM. If the 'DOMPurify' library is not present or fails to load, the user-controlled 'state.html' data is inserted into the DOM without being sanitized, which can lead to XSS attacks. An attacker can inject malicious scripts into 'state.html', which will then be executed in the context of the victim's session."
