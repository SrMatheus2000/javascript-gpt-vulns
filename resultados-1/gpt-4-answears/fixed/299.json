  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function does not validate the input parameters 'commandName', 'target', and 'message'. This could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. For example, if the 'commandName' or 'target' parameters can be controlled by an attacker, they could potentially inject malicious commands or targets. Similarly, if the 'message' parameter is not properly sanitized, it could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if the message is displayed in a web page without proper escaping. It's recommended to always validate and sanitize input data to prevent such vulnerabilities."
