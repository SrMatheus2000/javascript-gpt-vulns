  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["No validation for 'options' object", "No validation for 'key' parameter", "Potential for 'options' object pollution"],
  "description": "The function 'unique_name_451' does not validate the 'options' object and the 'key' parameter. This could lead to potential object pollution if the 'key' parameter is manipulated with prototype properties. Also, the function does not handle the error thrown by JSON.parse, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input is not valid JSON."
