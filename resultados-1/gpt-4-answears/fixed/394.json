  "description": "The provided JavaScript function does not appear to have any obvious vulnerabilities. It filters and maps over a list of signatures, and only processes signatures of type 'text' or 'binary'. It then creates verification objects for each of these signatures. Without more context, it's hard to say definitively, but there don't appear to be any common security issues like injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), or insecure direct object references (IDOR)."
