  "description": "The function 'connectToWifi' is vulnerable to OS command injection. The function uses 'execFile' to execute the 'nmcli' command with user-supplied input ('ap.ssid', 'ap.password', 'config.iface'). An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by providing specially crafted input. This could lead to arbitrary command execution on the system where the script is running."
