  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function unique_name_196 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it takes an input (msg) and directly injects it into the HTML of the page without properly sanitizing or escaping it. An attacker could potentially input a string of malicious JavaScript code as the msg parameter, which would then be executed when the page is loaded."
