  "description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the 'options' object that it receives as a parameter. This can lead to various vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, where an attacker could potentially insert malicious SQL code into the 'options' object, leading to unauthorized database access. Similarly, the lack of input validation can lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where an attacker could potentially insert malicious scripts into the 'options' object, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information. Additionally, the function does not check for the existence of the 'options' object before accessing its properties, which could lead to a TypeError if the function is called without any arguments."
