  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) because it sends a GET request to a URL that is constructed by appending user-controlled input (getArchiveName()) to a static base URL. An attacker could potentially manipulate the getArchiveName() function to make the server send a request to an arbitrary URL. This could be used to attack internal resources that are not normally accessible from the outside. Additionally, there is no input validation on the getArchiveName() function, which could lead to other types of attacks."
