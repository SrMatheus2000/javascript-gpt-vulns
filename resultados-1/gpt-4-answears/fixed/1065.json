  "vulnerabilities": ["Improper Input Validation", "SQL Injection", "Path Traversal"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to several types of attacks. Firstly, there is no input validation for the parameters, which can lead to unexpected behavior or even security vulnerabilities (CWE-20). Secondly, the function is vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks, as it directly uses the input parameters in a SQL query without any sanitization or parameterization (CWE-89). Lastly, the function is vulnerable to Path Traversal attacks, as it uses the input parameters to construct a file path without any sanitization or validation (CWE-22)."
