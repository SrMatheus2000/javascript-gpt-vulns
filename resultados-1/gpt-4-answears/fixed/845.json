  "description": "The function setColorTheme uses the eval function to execute code. Even though it uses eval-sanitizer to sanitize the input, it's generally a bad practice to use eval because it can lead to code injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially control the input to the eval function and execute arbitrary code."
