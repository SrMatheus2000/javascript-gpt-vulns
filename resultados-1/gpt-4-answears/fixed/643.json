  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it takes a URL from the user input and makes a request to it. An attacker can provide a URL of an internal resource, leading to unauthorized access. The function also does not validate the input URL, which can lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function exposes potentially sensitive information by sending the URL path in the request."
