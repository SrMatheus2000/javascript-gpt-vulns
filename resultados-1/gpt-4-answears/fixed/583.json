  "vulnerabilities": ["Prototype Pollution"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution which is a type of attack that occurs when an attacker is able to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. This vulnerability is due to the fact that the function does not properly validate the input 'i' and allows the '__proto__' property to be modified. This can lead to several types of attacks such as denial of service, property injection, or even remote code execution."
