  "vulnerabilities": ["Command Injection"],
  "description": "The function unique_name_122 is vulnerable to command injection. This is because it takes an argument 'commandOrArgs' and directly uses it in the 'execFile' function without proper sanitization or validation. An attacker could potentially provide a malicious string as 'commandOrArgs', which could lead to arbitrary command execution on the server where this code is running."
