  "description": "The function embedYoutubeIframe is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses the 'id' and 'youtubeParams' variables in the iframe src attribute without properly sanitizing them. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts by manipulating the 'data-youtube' or 'data-ytparams' attributes of the element that triggers this function."
