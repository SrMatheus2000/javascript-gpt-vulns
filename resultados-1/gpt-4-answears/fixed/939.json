  "description": "The function 'unique_name_533' is vulnerable to SQL Injection. The database name 'db' is directly concatenated into the SQL query without any sanitization or parameterization, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. This can lead to unauthorized access, data corruption or even data loss."
