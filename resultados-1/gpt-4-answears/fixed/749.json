  "description": "The function is vulnerable to several security issues. First, it exposes sensitive information through environment variables. If an attacker can access these variables, they can gain unauthorized access to the system. Second, it leaks information through error messages. This can provide an attacker with valuable information about the system. Third, it is vulnerable to CSRF attacks because it does not validate the origin of requests. Finally, it does not properly sanitize user input, making it vulnerable to XSS attacks."
