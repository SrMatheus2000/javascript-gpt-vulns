  "description": "The function does not validate the 'method' and 'contentType' inputs, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. It also exposes potentially sensitive information in error messages, such as the unsupported media type or disallowed method. Additionally, the function does not limit the size of the request body, which can lead to resource exhaustion if a large amount of data is sent."
