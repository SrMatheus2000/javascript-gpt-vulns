  "isVulnerable": true,

  "vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection"],
  "description": "The function 'runNpmCommand' is vulnerable to OS command injection because it directly uses the 'command' parameter in a call to 'child_process.exec'. An attacker could provide a malicious command as input, which would then be executed with the privileges of the process."
