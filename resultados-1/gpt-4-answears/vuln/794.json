  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input (req.url) to access file system (fs.lstatSync) without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server. It also exposes error details to users (console.log(error); res.end(error.toString())) which could lead to Information Exposure Through an Error Message (CWE-209) and Information Exposure (CWE-200). An attacker could use this information to understand the system and plan further attacks."
