  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal attack (also known as directory traversal) which allows an attacker to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. By manipulating variables that reference files with 'dot-dot-slash (../)' sequences and its variations, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration and critical system files. The vulnerability occurs due to the usage of user-supplied input without proper validation. This can be mitigated by implementing proper input validation and sanitization."
