  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'table' parameter from 'PMA_commonParams.get('table')' is directly concatenated into the 'question' string without any sanitization or encoding. If an attacker can control the value of 'table', they can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the user's browser when the 'question' string is rendered."
