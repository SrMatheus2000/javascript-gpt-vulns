  "vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection", "Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection because it concatenates a user-supplied input (options.file) directly into a command that is executed by the system. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands. Additionally, there is no input validation for the 'options' parameter, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors."
