  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to access file system paths without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access sensitive files or data outside of the intended directories. The function also exposes potential sensitive information through error messages (CWE-209) which could be used by an attacker to gain more knowledge about the system and aid in further attacks. Lastly, the function may set incorrect default permissions (CWE-276) which could allow unauthorized users to access or modify sensitive data or functionality."
