  "description": "The function is vulnerable to several security issues. First, it exposes sensitive information through environment variables. If an attacker can access these variables, they can gain unauthorized access to the system. Second, it leaks information through error messages. If an error occurs, the function logs the error message to the console, potentially revealing sensitive information. Third, it is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks because it does not validate the origin of requests. Finally, it is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks because it does not properly sanitize user input before using it to generate web pages."
