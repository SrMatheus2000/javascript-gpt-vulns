  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "Improper Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it uses user input in the 'state' parameter directly without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts. It's also vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) as it does not implement any anti-CSRF mechanisms, allowing an attacker to trick a victim into executing unwanted actions. Additionally, the function does not validate or sanitize user input properly, leading to potential security risks."
