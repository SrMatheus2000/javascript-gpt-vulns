  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to the use of regular expressions with potentially exponential worst-case complexity. An attacker could provide a specially crafted input that would cause the function to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service. Additionally, the function uses user-supplied input in regular expressions and in the construction of new GitHost objects without proper sanitization, which could lead to code injection if the input contains malicious code."
