  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the use of innerHTML property which allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code. If the 'row' variable is controlled by the user or can be manipulated, it can lead to XSS attacks. An attacker can inject malicious scripts into 'row' which will then be executed when the function is called."
