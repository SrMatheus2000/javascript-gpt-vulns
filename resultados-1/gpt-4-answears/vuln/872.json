  "description": "The function 'unique_name_459' is using 'ipcRenderer.sendSync' which is a synchronous inter-process communication method in Electron. This can be a potential security risk if untrusted input is passed to it, as it can allow for remote code execution. It's recommended to use context isolation and validate or sanitize inputs."
