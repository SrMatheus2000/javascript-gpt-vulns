  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Insecure use of Buffer"],
  "description": "The function uses the Buffer constructor, which is considered insecure because it can lead to various security issues if not used properly. If the input is a number, the Buffer constructor will allocate a new buffer of the specified size in bytes and potentially expose any old and likely sensitive data. It's recommended to use Buffer.from(), Buffer.alloc(), or Buffer.allocUnsafe() instead."
