  "vulnerabilities": ["Command Injection"],
  "description": "The function 'unique_name_788' is vulnerable to command injection because it concatenates a user-supplied 'command' directly into a string that is executed as a shell command. An attacker could provide a malicious command that gets executed with the privileges of the process running the JavaScript code. This could lead to arbitrary command execution, which is a serious security risk."
