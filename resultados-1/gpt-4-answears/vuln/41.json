  "vulnerabilities": ["Open Redirect Vulnerability"],
  "description": "The function 'getRedirectUrl' is vulnerable to open redirect attacks. It takes a URL from the query parameters and redirects the user to this URL. An attacker could exploit this by crafting a URL that redirects a user to a malicious site. This could be used for phishing attacks or to steal sensitive information. The function does not validate or sanitize the input URL, which makes it vulnerable to this type of attack."
