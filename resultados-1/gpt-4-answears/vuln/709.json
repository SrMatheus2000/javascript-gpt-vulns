  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Input Validation Vulnerability"],
  "description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the input before using it. This could lead to various types of attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, and Command Injection attacks. For instance, the function uses the 'this.contentType.value' and 'this.contentType.params.charset' directly without any validation. An attacker could potentially pass malicious scripts or commands through these parameters."
