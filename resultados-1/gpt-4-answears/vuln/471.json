  "description": "The function 'connectToWifi' is vulnerable to OS command injection. The function constructs a command string using user-supplied input (config.iface, ap.ssid, ap.password) without proper sanitization or validation. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by manipulating these inputs, leading to arbitrary command execution on the host system."
