  "description": "The function buildLogTable is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly inserts user-controlled data into HTML output without proper sanitization or encoding. Specifically, the function uses the jQuery .html(), .append(), and .data() methods to insert data into the DOM. If an attacker can control the 'data' input to the function, they could inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the context of the victim's browser when the generated HTML is rendered."
