  "description": "The function 'createProject' is vulnerable as it exposes sensitive information. The encryption key 'credentialSecret' is being stored in the 'metadata' object which can lead to exposure of sensitive information. If an attacker can access this object, they can retrieve the encryption key. This is a violation of privacy and can lead to information exposure. Additionally, the credentials are not sufficiently protected, as they are being stored in a file whose name is also stored in the 'metadata' object. If an attacker can access this object, they can retrieve the file name and potentially access the credentials."
