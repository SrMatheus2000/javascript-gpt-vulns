  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to access files without proper validation. This could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system. It is also vulnerable to OS Command Injection (CWE-78) as it uses user input in a command that is executed by the system. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. Lastly, it is vulnerable to Information Exposure (CWE-200) as it logs error messages that could contain sensitive information, potentially exposing it to an attacker."
