  "description": "The function unique_name_719 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly injects user-provided 'data' into the HTML content of various elements without properly sanitizing or escaping it. An attacker could exploit this by providing malicious script content in 'data', which would then be executed in the context of the victim's browser when the page is rendered."
