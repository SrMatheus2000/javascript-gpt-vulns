  "description": "The function 'collectBody' creates a buffer of size based on the 'Content-length' header of the request. This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if an attacker sends a request with a very large 'Content-length' value, causing the server to consume excessive resources (CWE-400). Additionally, error messages are directly sent to the client in the 'forwardResponse' function, potentially exposing sensitive server information (CWE-209). The function also does not validate the input it receives, which can lead to various attacks if the input is manipulated (CWE-20)."
