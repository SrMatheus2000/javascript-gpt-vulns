  "": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks because it directly uses user input in the 'innerHTML' property. An attacker could inject malicious scripts by providing a specially crafted 'option.text' value. This script would then be executed whenever the option is rendered on the webpage. This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
