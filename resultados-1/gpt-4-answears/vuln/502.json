  "": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks because it directly inserts user input into HTML without proper sanitization or escaping. An attacker could inject malicious scripts by providing a 'key' or 'value' that includes script tags. This script would then be executed when the HTML is rendered in a browser."
