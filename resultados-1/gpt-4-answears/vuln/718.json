  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct a file path without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access, read, or write files outside of the intended directory. It's also vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79) as it directly uses user input in the response without proper encoding or escaping. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts. Lastly, it's vulnerable to SQL Injection (CWE-89) as it uses user input directly in a database query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the query and access, modify, or delete data in the database."
