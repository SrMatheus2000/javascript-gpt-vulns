  "description": "The function deepCopy is vulnerable to a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack. If the sourceObj has a circular reference, the function will enter an infinite loop, consuming resources until the application crashes. This is due to the recursive nature of the function without a proper base case to handle such scenarios."
