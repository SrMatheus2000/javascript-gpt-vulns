  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection"],
  "description": "The function 'getterFn' is vulnerable to code injection. This is because it dynamically generates code using the 'Function' constructor with user-supplied input ('path'). An attacker could potentially supply a 'path' that includes malicious code, leading to arbitrary code execution."
