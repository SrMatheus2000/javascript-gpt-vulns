  "description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection because it directly uses user input in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the SQL query and potentially access, modify or delete data in the database. The function also lacks proper input validation, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) because it directly includes user input in the response without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are executed in the context of the user's browser."
