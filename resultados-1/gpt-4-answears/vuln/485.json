  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input to construct file paths without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access, read, or modify files outside of the intended directory. It is also vulnerable to SQL Injection (CWE-89) as it uses user-supplied input in SQL queries without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to manipulate SQL queries and potentially access, modify, or delete data in the database. The function is also vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (CWE-79) as it uses user-supplied input in HTML output without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts and potentially steal sensitive data or perform actions on behalf of the user. Lastly, the function is vulnerable to Information Exposure (CWE-200) as it exposes sensitive information such as user passwords in the response."
