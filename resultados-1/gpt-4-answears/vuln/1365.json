  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it does not validate the 'version' parameter which is concatenated directly into the URL. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the path to access and download arbitrary files. It is also vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (CWE-94) as it downloads and writes a file from an external source without any validation, potentially leading to execution of malicious code. Lastly, it is vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) as it does not limit the size of the file being downloaded, which could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack."
