  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the use of the .html() and .append() methods, which insert user-controlled input into the HTML document. If the input is not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the victim."
