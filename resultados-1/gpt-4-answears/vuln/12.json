  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it takes a URL from the response headers and makes a request to it without any validation. This could allow an attacker to make the server send requests to arbitrary URLs, potentially accessing sensitive information. Additionally, there is no input validation on the 'chunk' data received in the 'data' event listener, which could lead to other types of attacks."
