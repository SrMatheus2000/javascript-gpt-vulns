  "description": "The function is vulnerable to code injection attacks as it uses the Function constructor to create new functions from strings, which can lead to execution of arbitrary code if the input is not properly sanitized. Additionally, the function may expose sensitive information through error messages, which can provide useful information to an attacker."
