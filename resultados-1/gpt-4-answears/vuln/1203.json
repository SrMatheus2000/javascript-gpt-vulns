  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "Improper Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it directly injects the response body into the HTML without sanitizing it first. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts. It's also vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) because it does not verify if the request was intentionally made by the user. Lastly, it does not validate the input from the form element, which could lead to unexpected behavior."
