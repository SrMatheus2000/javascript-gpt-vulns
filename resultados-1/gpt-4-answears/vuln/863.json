  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it uses the 'dangerouslySetInnerHTML' property to set the HTML content of the 'FormInput' component. If the 'md' property of 'this.props.value' contains malicious script, it will be executed when the component is rendered. This can lead to various security issues such as data theft, session hijacking, and defacement of the website."
