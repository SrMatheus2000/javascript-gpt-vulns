  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) because it uses user input to construct a file path without proper sanitization. An attacker could manipulate the 'path' variable to access arbitrary files on the system. It's also vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79) because it directly uses user input in the 'handler.handler' function without proper output encoding or validation, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts."
