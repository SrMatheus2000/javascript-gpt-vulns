  "description": "The function unique_name_381 is vulnerable to command injection. The function uses the 'exec' function to execute the 'ipconfig /all' command. However, it does not properly sanitize the 'iface' parameter before using it in the command. An attacker could provide a malicious 'iface' value that alters the command to execute arbitrary commands on the system."
