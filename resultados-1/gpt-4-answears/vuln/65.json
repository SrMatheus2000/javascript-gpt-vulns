  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Prototype Pollution"],
  "description": "The function 'getLastOfPath' is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. This is because it allows the modification of the prototype of 'object' when 'key' is '__proto__' or 'constructor'. An attacker can manipulate these attributes to add or modify properties of 'Object.prototype'. This can lead to several issues like denial of service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), or even lead to other vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)."
