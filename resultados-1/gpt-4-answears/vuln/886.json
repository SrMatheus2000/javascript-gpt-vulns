  "description": "The function 'unique_name_466' is vulnerable as it does not encrypt sensitive data (passwords) which can lead to exposure of sensitive information. It also uses a one-way hash without a salt, making it susceptible to rainbow table attacks. A salt is a random value that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data or passwords. The absence of a salt allows an attacker to pre-compute the hash value using dictionary attack or rainbow tables."
