  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Unvalidated input", "Potential null pointer dereference"],
  "description": "The function does not validate the 'files' input, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the input is not as expected. Additionally, the function does not check if 'options' is defined before accessing its properties, which could lead to a null pointer dereference if 'options' is undefined."
