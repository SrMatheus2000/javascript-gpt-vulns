  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Path Traversal"],
  "description": "The function 'fileCompletion' is vulnerable to path traversal attacks. The 'req' parameter is concatenated directly into the 'pattern' variable without any sanitization or validation. This means an attacker could potentially provide a 'req' value such as '../../../etc/passwd' to access sensitive files on the server. This vulnerability is classified as CWE-22."
