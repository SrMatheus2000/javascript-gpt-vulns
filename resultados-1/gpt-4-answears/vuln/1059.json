  "description": "The function unique_name_587 is vulnerable to SQL Injection. The indexName parameter is directly concatenated into the SQL query without any sanitization or parameterization, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. This could lead to unauthorized viewing, modification, or deletion of data in the database."
