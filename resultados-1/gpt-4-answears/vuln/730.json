  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal attacks (CWE-22). The function checks if the pathname contains '../', which is a common way to navigate to parent directories. However, this check can be bypassed by URL encoding the '../' to '%2e%2e%2f'. After the decodeURI function decodes the pathname, the '../' will appear again, but the check for '../' has already been done. An attacker can use this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the system."
