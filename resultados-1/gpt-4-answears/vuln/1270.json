  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-78", "CWE-89", "CWE-20"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection", "SQL Injection", "Improper Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection because it directly includes user-supplied data (pid and signal) in a command that is executed by the system. An attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary commands in the system. The function also lacks proper input validation, which could lead to SQL injection if the pid or signal parameters contain SQL commands."
