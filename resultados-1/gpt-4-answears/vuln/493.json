  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that user input is directly inserted into HTML code without proper sanitization or encoding. Specifically, the 'elementName' and 'id' variables are directly inserted into the HTML code, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts."
