If 'options' is not an object, the function will throw an error when it tries to access its properties. This is a type confusion vulnerability. Additionally, the function does not validate the type of the 'field' property of the 'options' object. If 'field' is not a string, the function will throw an error when it tries to compare it to a string. This is another type confusion vulnerability."
