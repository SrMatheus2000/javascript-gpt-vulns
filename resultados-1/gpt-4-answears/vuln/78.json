  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the use of innerHTML property in several places, which allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through the 'legendNames', 'text', 'w.config.legend.markers.customHTML' and other variables that are used in the function. These scripts can be used to steal sensitive information, perform actions on behalf of the user, or other malicious activities."
