  "description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the 'params' input, which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the input is controlled by an attacker. This can allow the attacker to inject malicious scripts and potentially compromise the application. Additionally, the function does not check if 'params.parent' or 'params.content' are of the expected types, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors."
