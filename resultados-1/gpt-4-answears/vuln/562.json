  "description": "The function unique_name_286 takes an HTML string as input and processes it to a tree structure. However, it does not sanitize the input HTML string before processing it. This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if the input HTML string contains malicious scripts. An attacker could inject scripts that steal sensitive information or perform other malicious actions."
