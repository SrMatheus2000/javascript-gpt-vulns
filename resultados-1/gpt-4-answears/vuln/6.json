  "description": "The function is intended to remove XML processing instructions from an SVG string, but it does not properly sanitize the input. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts, leading to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim's browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites."
