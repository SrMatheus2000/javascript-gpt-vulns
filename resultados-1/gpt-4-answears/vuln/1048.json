It creates a secure context using TLS (Transport Layer Security), removes all listeners from the socket and protocol, creates a secure socket, pipes data between the secure socket and the protocol, and starts TLS communications. All these operations are standard for establishing a secure connection and do not expose any known vulnerabilities."
