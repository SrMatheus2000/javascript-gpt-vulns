  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to access files (filePath is constructed using req.url). An attacker could manipulate the path to access sensitive files outside of the intended directory. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Information Exposure (CWE-200) as it logs sensitive information such as the request method, URL, and response status code, which could be exploited to gain further information about the system."
