  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) because it sends a request to a URL that is constructed by concatenating a static string with a value returned by the getArchiveName() function, which could potentially be manipulated to make the server send a request to an arbitrary URL. This could be exploited to perform actions on other internal services that the server has access to. The function also does not validate the input from the getArchiveName() function, which could lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function does not limit the size of the data that it downloads, which could lead to resource exhaustion if an attacker makes it download a large file."
