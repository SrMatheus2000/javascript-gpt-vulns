  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function unique_name_263 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it uses the jQuery $ function to parse the 'message' parameter, which can contain user-supplied data. If an attacker can control the content of 'message', they can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of the victim's session. This can lead to a variety of attacks, such as session theft, account takeover, and defacement of the website."
