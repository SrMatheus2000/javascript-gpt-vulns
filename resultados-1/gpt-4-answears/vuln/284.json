  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it uses the innerHTML property to insert complex HTML in several places. If an attacker can control the input to these calls, they can inject scripts that are executed when the user interacts with the page. This can lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing the user's cookies or performing actions on their behalf."
