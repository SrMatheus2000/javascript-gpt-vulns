  "description": "The function unique_name_342 is vulnerable to both Code Injection and Path Traversal attacks. The 'name' variable, which is used to require a module, is directly taken from the 'apis' parameter without any sanitization or validation. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code or traverse the file system to access restricted directories."
