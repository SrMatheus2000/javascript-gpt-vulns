  "vulnerabilities": ["Denial of Service (DoS)", "Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function does not validate the 'opts' parameter, which can lead to unexpected behavior if it is not an object or if it does not contain the expected properties. This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) if an attacker can control the 'opts' parameter and pass in a large array for 'opts.method', causing the function to consume excessive resources while processing the array. Additionally, the function does not validate the 'opts.method' and 'opts.url' properties, which can lead to unexpected behavior if they are not strings."
