  "vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection", "SQL Injection", "Improper Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection as it directly uses user-provided input (cmd, cmdArgs) in a command that is executed by the system. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. Additionally, the function does not appear to validate or sanitize the input, which could lead to other types of injection attacks, such as SQL injection if the input is used in a database query. The function also exposes sensitive information (username, password) in error messages, which could be exploited by an attacker."
