  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection"],
  "description": "The function 'compile' is vulnerable to code injection. It dynamically generates code using the 'new Function' constructor, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if user-supplied input is passed without proper sanitization. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code through the 'format' parameter."
