  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses the 'PMA_commonParams.get('table')' value in the HTML content. If an attacker can control the value of 'table', they can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the user's browser."
