  "description": "The function 'createPrivateKey' is vulnerable due to the use of insecure randomness and potential for resource exhaustion. The 'keyBitsize' is not securely randomized, which could lead to predictable keys and compromise the security of the system (CWE-330). Additionally, the function does not limit the size of 'keyBitsize', which could lead to excessive resource consumption if a large value is provided (CWE-400)."
