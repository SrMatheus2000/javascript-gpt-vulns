  "vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection", "Path Traversal"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection because it uses user-supplied input in the 'execSync' function without proper sanitization or validation. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to path traversal attacks because it uses user-supplied input to construct file paths without proper validation. This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete files outside of the intended directories."
