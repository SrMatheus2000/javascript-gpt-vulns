  "description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection (CWE-89) as it directly uses user inputs in database queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This could allow an attacker to manipulate SQL queries and gain unauthorized access to the database. It is also vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79) as it does not properly sanitize user inputs before using them in the application's output. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts and perform actions on behalf of the user. The function also lacks proper input validation (CWE-20), which could lead to various types of attacks such as directory traversal, command injection, etc."
