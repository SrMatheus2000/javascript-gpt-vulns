  "description": "The function 'unique_name_620' is vulnerable due to several reasons. Firstly, it exposes sensitive information such as secret keys and tokens which can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access (CWE-200). Secondly, it does not encrypt sensitive data (CWE-311), making it vulnerable to attacks where an attacker can read or modify the sensitive data. Thirdly, it uses insufficiently random values for generating tokens (CWE-330), which can be predicted by an attacker. Lastly, the function does not handle session expiration properly, making it vulnerable to session hijacking attacks."
