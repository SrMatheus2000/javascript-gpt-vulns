  "description": "The function unique_name_745 is vulnerable to OS command injection. The 'name' parameter is directly concatenated into the command string without any sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by providing a specially crafted 'name' parameter. For example, if an attacker provides a 'name' parameter of '; rm -rf /', the function will execute the command 'ps -ef | grep ; rm -rf /', which will delete all files on the system. This vulnerability is classified as CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')."
