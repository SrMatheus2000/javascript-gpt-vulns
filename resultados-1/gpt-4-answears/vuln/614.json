  "description": "The function unique_name_311 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) because it directly uses user input in 'item.innerHTML = match( string, option );' without properly sanitizing it. An attacker could inject malicious scripts by manipulating the 'string' or 'option' variables."
