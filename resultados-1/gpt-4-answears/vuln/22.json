  "vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection"],
  "description": "The function unique_name_6 is vulnerable to OS command injection. The function uses the exec function to execute system commands, and it directly includes user-supplied input (the 'port' parameter) in the command without properly sanitizing it. An attacker could provide a malicious input that includes command separators or other special characters, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the system."
