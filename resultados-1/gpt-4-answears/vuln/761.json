  "description": "The function 'finishModule' is vulnerable to path traversal attacks because it does not validate or sanitize the 'stageTo' and 'stageFrom' parameters before using them in file operations. An attacker could potentially manipulate these parameters to access, modify, or delete files outside of the intended directory. Additionally, the function may incorrectly resolve names or references due to the lack of validation or error handling."
