  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "Information Exposure", "Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) as it does not implement any form of anti-CSRF measures such as tokens. This could allow an attacker to trick a victim into performing actions on their behalf. Additionally, the function exposes sensitive information by storing privileged user data in a cookie without proper encryption, which could lead to information disclosure if the cookie is intercepted. Lastly, the function sets a cookie without the 'Secure' attribute in an HTTPS session, which could allow an attacker to intercept the cookie over an insecure connection."
