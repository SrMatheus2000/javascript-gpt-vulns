  "description": "The function does not sanitize the 'url' parameter before using it to load a URL. This could potentially lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if an attacker is able to control the 'url' parameter, as they could inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the context of the victim's session."
