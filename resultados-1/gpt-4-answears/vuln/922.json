  "description": "The function 'uncapitalise' is vulnerable to Open Redirect attacks. This is because it uses user input (req.path) to determine the redirection URL without properly validating or sanitizing it. An attacker could manipulate 'req.path' to redirect users to an arbitrary website. This could be used for phishing attacks or to steal sensitive information. Additionally, the function does not properly validate the input before using it in a regular expression, which could lead to other potential vulnerabilities."
