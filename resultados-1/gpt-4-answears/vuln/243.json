  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses the 'row' variable to set the 'innerHTML' of the 'divRow' element without sanitizing it. If the 'row' variable contains malicious scripts, they will be executed when the 'divRow' element is rendered in the browser."
