  "vulnerabilities": ["Denial of Service (DoS)", "Buffer Overflow"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and Buffer Overflow. The 'Content-length' header is directly used to allocate a buffer, without any checks on its value. An attacker can send a very large number, causing the server to run out of memory (DoS). Additionally, the 'copy' method is used without checking if the chunk size exceeds the buffer size, which can lead to Buffer Overflow."
