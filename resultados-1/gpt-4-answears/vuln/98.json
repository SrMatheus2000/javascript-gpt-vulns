  "vulnerabilities": ["Denial of Service (DoS)", "Type confusion"],
  "description": "The function 'decodeString' is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks due to the lack of input validation and potential for infinite loops. If a malicious user provides a specially crafted string, it could cause the application to enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU resources and potentially causing the application to crash or become unresponsive (CWE-400). Additionally, the function does not properly validate the type of the input, which could lead to type confusion vulnerabilities (CWE-20)."
