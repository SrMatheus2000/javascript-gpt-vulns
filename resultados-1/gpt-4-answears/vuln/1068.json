  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function unique_name_593() is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. It directly uses the 'title' attribute of an element without sanitizing it. If an attacker can control the 'title' attribute, they can inject malicious scripts, leading to XSS attacks. This can lead to various security issues like stealing sensitive information, session hijacking, defacement of the website, etc."
