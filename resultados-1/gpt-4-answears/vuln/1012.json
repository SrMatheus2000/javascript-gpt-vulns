  "description": "The function attempts to prevent Cross-site Scripting (XSS) by removing 'script' tags from the input. However, this is not a comprehensive solution and can be bypassed. For example, an attacker could use event handlers like 'onmouseover' or 'onload' in other HTML tags to execute arbitrary JavaScript code. Moreover, the function does not escape other special characters that could be used to inject malicious code."
