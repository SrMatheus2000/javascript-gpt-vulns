  "description": "The function unique_name_598 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input to create HTML tags and content without sanitizing or encoding it. An attacker could inject malicious scripts through the 'tag', 'no_data_class', or 'no_data_text' properties of the 'opts' object, which would then be executed when the generated HTML is rendered in a web browser."
