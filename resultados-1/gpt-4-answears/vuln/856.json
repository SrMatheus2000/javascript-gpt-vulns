  "description": "The function 'unique_name_451' is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that it directly uses user input in the generation of HTML without properly sanitizing it. An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the browser of any user viewing the generated page. This can lead to a variety of attacks such as stealing session cookies, performing actions on behalf of the user, or delivering malware."
