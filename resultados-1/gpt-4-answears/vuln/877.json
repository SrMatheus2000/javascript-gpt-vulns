  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function listens to various events and directly uses the data received from these events without any sanitization or encoding. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts through these events, which will then be executed in the user's browser. For example, the 'page-title-updated' event directly sets the title of the page to the data received from the event. If an attacker can control this data, they can inject a script that will be executed every time the page title is updated."
