  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Use of Deprecated or Unsafe Function"],
  "description": "The function uses the 'new Buffer()' constructor, which is deprecated and unsafe due to security and usability issues. It can lead to several issues like uninitialized memory exposure if a number is passed as argument, or out-of-memory errors. It's recommended to use 'Buffer.from()', 'Buffer.alloc()', or 'Buffer.allocUnsafe()' instead."
