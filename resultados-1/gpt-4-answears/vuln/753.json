  "description": "The provided JavaScript function does not appear to have any obvious vulnerabilities. It is simply setting some configuration paths based on a provided prefix. There is no user input being directly used in a dangerous way, such as being inserted into a database query or used to build a file path without sanitization. However, without the full context of the application, it's impossible to say for certain that there are no vulnerabilities."
