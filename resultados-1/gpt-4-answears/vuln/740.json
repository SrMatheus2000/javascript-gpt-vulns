  "CWEs": ["CWE-79", "CWE-89", "CWE-20"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "SQL Injection", "Improper Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it uses the 'rendy' function to directly insert user-controlled input into HTML output, which can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious scripts. It's also vulnerable to SQL Injection because it concatenates user-controlled input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. Furthermore, the function does not validate or sanitize the user-controlled input in 'params', which can lead to various types of attacks."
