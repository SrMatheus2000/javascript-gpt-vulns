  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-319", "CWE-200"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "Information Exposure"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable as it uses Basic Authentication which transmits credentials in cleartext. This can expose sensitive information, leading to potential unauthorized access. The credentials are encoded with Base64 before transmission, but Base64 is not a secure encryption method. Anyone who intercepts the traffic can easily decode the Base64 string and retrieve the original credentials. This vulnerability corresponds to CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information). Additionally, the function exposes detailed error messages that include stack traces and cause of the error. This can provide an attacker with valuable information about the system, leading to further attacks. This vulnerability corresponds to CWE-200 (Information Exposure)."
