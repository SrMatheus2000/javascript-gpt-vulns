  "description": "The function is vulnerable to information exposure as it logs error messages to the console which may contain sensitive information. This is a violation of CWE-200 and CWE-209. Additionally, the function does not limit the size of the request body, making it vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks (CWE-400). An attacker could send a large amount of data in the body of the request, causing the server to consume excessive resources and potentially leading to a denial of service."
