  "isVulnerable": true,

  "description": "The function unique_name_122 is vulnerable to OS command injection. The function uses the cp.exec function to execute git commands. However, it does not properly sanitize the input parameters 'files', 'message', 'newVer', and 'tagName' before using them in the command string. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands through these parameters. Although the function attempts to sanitize the 'message' parameter by replacing certain characters, this is not sufficient to prevent all forms of command injection. The vulnerability corresponds to CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')."
