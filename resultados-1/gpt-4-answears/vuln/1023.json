  "vulnerabilities": ["Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)", "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) because it uses user input in a regular expression without proper sanitization. This can lead to excessive consumption of CPU resources. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks because it does not properly escape or encode the output. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts."
