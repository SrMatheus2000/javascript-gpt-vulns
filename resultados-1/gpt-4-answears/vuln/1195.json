  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input to update the HTML content of an element using the .html() method. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through the user input, which will then be executed in the user's browser when the updated HTML content is rendered."
