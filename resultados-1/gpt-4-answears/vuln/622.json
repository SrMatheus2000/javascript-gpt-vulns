  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input in 'options.path' without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system. Additionally, it exposes potentially sensitive information in error messages (CWE-209) when the 'options.strip' value is greater than the number of directories, which could provide useful information to an attacker."
