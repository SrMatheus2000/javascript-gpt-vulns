  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The href, title, and text parameters are directly concatenated into the output HTML without any sanitization or encoding, which means that an attacker could inject malicious scripts through these parameters. The function attempts to sanitize the href parameter by checking if it starts with 'javascript:' or 'vbscript:', but this check can be easily bypassed. For example, an attacker could use a URL that starts with 'data:text/html;base64,' followed by a base64-encoded script. The function also does not sanitize or encode the title and text parameters at all, which means that an attacker could inject scripts through these parameters as well."
