  "description": "The function unique_name_763 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the use of innerHTML property on the 'firstDiv' element. The innerHTML property sets or returns the HTML content (inner HTML) of an element. If the HTML content is not properly sanitized before being assigned to the innerHTML property, it can lead to XSS attacks. In this case, the function sanitizeHtmlCode is used to sanitize the 'firstLine' variable before it is assigned to the innerHTML property. However, if the sanitizeHtmlCode function does not properly sanitize the input, it can lead to XSS attacks."
