  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function directly manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM) by appending child elements to the body of the document. If an attacker can control the input to the '_svgTag' variable, they could inject malicious scripts that would be executed when the SVG element is rendered in the browser. This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
