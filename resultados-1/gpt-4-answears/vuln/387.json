  "description": "The function unique_name_188 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function takes a URL, width, and height as parameters and directly inserts them into an HTML string without any sanitization or encoding. An attacker could potentially provide a malicious script as the URL, which would then be executed when the resulting HTML is rendered in a web browser."
