  "description": "The function inetLatency is vulnerable to OS command injection. The function constructs a command to be executed using the 'exec' function with the 'host' parameter being included in the command string without proper sanitization or validation. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands to be executed on the system with the privileges of the process running the script. The vulnerability is mitigated by the use of the 'util.sanitizeShellString' function, but it is still a bad practice to construct commands in this way. The vulnerability corresponds to CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')."
