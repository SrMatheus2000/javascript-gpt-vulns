  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and HTML Injection attacks. The function does not properly sanitize the HTML input. It only checks for 'script' and 'noscript' tags and attributes starting with 'on', but there are many other ways to execute JavaScript in HTML. For example, an attacker could use the 'img' tag with the 'src' attribute set to 'javascript:alert(1)'. Also, the function does not escape special HTML characters, which could lead to HTML Injection attacks."
