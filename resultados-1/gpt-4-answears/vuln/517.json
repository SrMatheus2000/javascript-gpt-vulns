  "description": "The function unique_name_256 is vulnerable to SQL Injection. The function takes a 'column' and a 'path' as parameters and uses them to construct SQL queries without properly sanitizing them. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the queries, leading to unauthorized access to data, data corruption, or data loss."
