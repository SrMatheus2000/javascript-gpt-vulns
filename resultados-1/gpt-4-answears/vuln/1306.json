  "vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection", "Improper Input Validation", "Information Exposure"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection because it uses user-supplied input in OS commands without proper sanitization. This is evident in the 'set', 'get', 'remove', and 'clear' methods of the 'wfVars' object where user-supplied input is directly used in OS commands. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. The function also lacks proper input validation which can lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function may expose sensitive information through error messages or console logs."
