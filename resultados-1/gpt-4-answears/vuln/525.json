  "description": "The function unique_name_257 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input (t.matched) in the creation of HTML content without sanitizing it first. An attacker could potentially input a string that includes malicious JavaScript code, which would then be executed when the HTML is rendered."
