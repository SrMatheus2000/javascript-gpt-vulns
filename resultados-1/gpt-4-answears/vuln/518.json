  "description": "The function jsonPathExtractionQuery is vulnerable to SQL Injection. The function takes two parameters, column and path, and uses them to construct an SQL query. However, it does not sanitize or validate these inputs before using them, which means that an attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code. This could lead to unauthorized access to data, data corruption, or even data loss."
