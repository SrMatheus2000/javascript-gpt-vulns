  "description": "The function unique_name_510 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability exists because the function does not properly sanitize the attribute values of the currentNode object. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through the attribute values, which will be executed when the currentNode is rendered in a web page. The regex used to check for script or data protocols in the attribute values can be bypassed by using encoding or obfuscation techniques."
