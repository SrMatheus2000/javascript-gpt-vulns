  "description": "The function does not properly validate the input 'data'. It attempts to convert non-string inputs to a string using the toString method, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the input is an object with a maliciously crafted toString method. This is a type coercion vulnerability. Additionally, the function constructs a regular expression from user-controlled input (this.options.sectionOpenIdentifier and this.options.sectionCloseIdentifier), which can lead to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) if the input is a specially crafted string that causes excessive backtracking. It can also lead to potential code injection if the user-controlled input is used in a way that allows for arbitrary code execution."
