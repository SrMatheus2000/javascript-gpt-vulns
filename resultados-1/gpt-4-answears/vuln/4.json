  "description": "The function htmlEncode is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it takes an input (text) and directly uses it to create a text node which is then appended to a new HTML element. If the input is not properly sanitized and contains malicious scripts, these scripts will be executed when the HTML is rendered in a browser. This can lead to various security issues such as session hijacking, identity theft, defacement of the website, and other malicious activities."
