  "isVulnerable": true,

  "vulnerabilities": ["Prototype Pollution", "Potential Denial of Service"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution which can lead to multiple application-level vulnerabilities such as Remote Code Execution, Property Injection, etc. This happens because the function does not prevent the modification of the Object prototype. Also, the function does not have any mechanism to prevent a large amount of data to be processed, which can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack."
