  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["No null check for parent", "No type check for parent", "No null check for editor", "No type check for editor", "No null check for node", "No type check for node"],
  "description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the input 'nodes'. It assumes that 'nodes' is always an array, which may not be the case. It also assumes that each node has a 'parent' and 'editor' property, and that these properties are of the correct type. If these assumptions are not met, the function will throw an error. This could potentially be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service. Additionally, the function does not check if the 'clone' function or 'getFieldNames' function exist before calling them, which could also lead to errors."
