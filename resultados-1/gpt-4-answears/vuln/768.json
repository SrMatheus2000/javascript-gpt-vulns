  "description": "The function 'makeDestination' is vulnerable to path traversal attacks. The function uses user-supplied input to construct a filesystem path without properly validating or sanitizing the input. An attacker can manipulate the 'to' variable to navigate the filesystem outside of the intended directory. This can lead to unauthorized access to files and directories."
