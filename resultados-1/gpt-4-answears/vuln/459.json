  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input (req.urlBase) to access files (README.md) without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access sensitive files outside of the intended directories. Additionally, the function may expose sensitive information (CWE-200) as it returns the content of README.md files which could contain sensitive information."
