  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection"],
  "description": "The function 'unique_name_677' is vulnerable to code injection. It takes an input 'src' and directly passes it to the Function constructor. This allows for arbitrary code execution if a malicious string is passed as 'src'. An attacker could exploit this to run arbitrary code in the context of the application, leading to a variety of attacks such as data theft, denial of service, or even full system compromise."
