  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Unvalidated Input"],
  "description": "The function does not validate the input parameters before using them. This could lead to various issues such as unexpected behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities. For example, if the 'fieldName' is not a string, or if 'stream' is not a valid stream object, the function could crash or behave unexpectedly. Similarly, if 'filename', 'encoding', or 'mimetype' are not properly validated, they could be used in a way that leads to security vulnerabilities such as code injection or path traversal attacks."
