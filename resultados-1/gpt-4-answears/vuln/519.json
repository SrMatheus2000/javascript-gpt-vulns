  "": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks because it directly assigns user-controlled input to the innerHTML property of an element. An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web page, which would then be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
