  "description": "The function does not validate the input 'quad' before using it. If 'quad' is not in the expected format, it could cause an error and crash the application, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Additionally, the function does not limit the size of the '_gspo' object. If 'quad' contains a large amount of data, it could lead to excessive memory consumption, causing the application to slow down or crash, which is a form of Uncontrolled Resource Consumption."
