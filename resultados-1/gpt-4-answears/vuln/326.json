  "vulnerabilities": ["Exposure of sensitive information", "Improper input validation"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable as it exposes sensitive information by unlocking the account and pushing the address into an array which can be accessed. Also, there is no validation of the input 'n', which can lead to unexpected behavior if it is not a number or if it is a negative number."
