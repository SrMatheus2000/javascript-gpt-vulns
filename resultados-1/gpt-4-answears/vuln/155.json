  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function '_transformMeasurements' is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM) by appending child elements to the 'body' of the document. If an attacker can control the content of 'this._svgTag', they could inject malicious scripts that would be executed when the SVG element is rendered in the browser. This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
