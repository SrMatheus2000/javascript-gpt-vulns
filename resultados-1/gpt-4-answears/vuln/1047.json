  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Improper Input Validation", "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"],
  "description": "The function does not validate the input 'this.source' before processing it. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the input is not as expected. Additionally, the function does not control the consumption of resources when processing the 'paths' object. If the 'paths' object is large, it could lead to excessive consumption of resources, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition."
