  "description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection because it does not properly sanitize the 'commentID' parameter before using it in a database query. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the SQL query and potentially access, modify or delete data in the database. The function is also vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it does not properly sanitize user input before including it in the generated web page. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, which would then be executed in the context of the victim's browser. Additionally, the function may expose sensitive information such as user data and configuration details, which could be exploited by an attacker to gain further access to the system."
