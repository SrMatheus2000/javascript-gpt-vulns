  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) because it uses user-supplied input in 'request.url' without proper validation or sanitization, which can allow an attacker to access arbitrary files. It also exposes sensitive information through error messages (CWE-209) by including 'filePath' and 'error' details in the response. Additionally, the function does not validate or sanitize the 'options.historyApiFallback' input, leading to Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)."
