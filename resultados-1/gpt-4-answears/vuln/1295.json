  "description": "The function `inlineCodeRenderer` is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly inserts user-controlled data (`code.content`, `lang`) into HTML output without proper sanitization or encoding. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts by providing specially crafted input, leading to XSS. This is related to CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')."
