  "description": "The function unique_name_116 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly assigns the 'placeholder' variable to the innerHTML of 'this.placeEl' without sanitizing it. If the 'placeholder' variable contains malicious script, it will be executed when the HTML is rendered. This can lead to various security issues such as stealing sensitive information, session hijacking, and defacement of the website."
