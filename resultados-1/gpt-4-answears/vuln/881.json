  "description": "The function 'getType' is vulnerable to Path Traversal attacks (also known as Directory Traversal). This is due to the fact that it takes a 'path' parameter and uses it to access file system resources without properly validating or sanitizing it. An attacker could potentially exploit this by providing a path that includes special sequences (like '../') to navigate to arbitrary directories and access sensitive files on the server."
