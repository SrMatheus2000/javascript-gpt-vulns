  "description": "The function does not validate the 'options' parameter, which can lead to a null pointer exception if 'options.execute' is accessed when 'options' is null or undefined. This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if an attacker can control the 'options' parameter. Additionally, the function does not limit the number of clients that can be added to the 'Clients' array, which can lead to excessive resource consumption if a large number of clients are added, potentially leading to a DoS attack."
