  "description": "The function PMA_unInlineEditRow is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the use of the .html() method in jQuery, which sets the HTML content of an element. If the content being set is user-controlled and not properly sanitized, it can lead to XSS attacks. In this function, the .html() method is used to set the content of $this_sibling with the value of new_html, which can be controlled by the user."
