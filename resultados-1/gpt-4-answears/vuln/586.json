  "description": "The function 'unique_name_301' is vulnerable to code injection. It concatenates the 'code' parameter directly into a string that is then executed by 'vm.runInContext'. An attacker could provide malicious JavaScript code as the 'code' parameter, which would then be executed in the context of the application."
