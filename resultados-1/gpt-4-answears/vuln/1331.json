  "description": "The function is vulnerable to several types of attacks. The use of 'fs.writeFileSync' and 'fs.readFileSync' can lead to Path Traversal attacks (CWE-22) if user-supplied input is used for the 'filePath' parameter. The use of 'exec' function can lead to OS Command Injection (CWE-78) if user-supplied input is used for the 'config.grep' parameter. The use of 'require' in 'generateRunner' function can lead to Code Injection (CWE-94) if user-supplied input is used for the 'filePath' parameter. The use of 'JSON.parse' can lead to Use of Potentially Dangerous Function (CWE-676) if user-supplied input is used for the 'config.cachePath' parameter."
