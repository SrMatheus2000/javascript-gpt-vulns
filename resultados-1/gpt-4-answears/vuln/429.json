  "": "The function unique_name_203 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses the 'text' parameter to set the innerHTML of the 'statusElem' element. An attacker could potentially pass malicious script as the 'text' parameter, which would then be executed when the HTML is rendered."
