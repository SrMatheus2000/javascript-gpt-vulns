  "description": "The function jsonPathExtractionQuery takes two parameters, column and path, and uses them to construct an SQL query. However, it does not properly sanitize these inputs before using them in the query. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query, leading to SQL Injection vulnerability. This is especially dangerous if the function is used with user-supplied data. The function should be modified to properly sanitize the inputs before using them in the SQL query."
