  "description": "The function 'handleStaticFile' uses 'fs.statSync' which is a synchronous function that can block the event loop and potentially lead to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks (CWE-400). Also, the function 'handleNoMatchedRoute' uses 'decodeURIComponent(reqUrl)' to get the path to the file, which can lead to Path Traversal attacks (CWE-22) if the 'reqUrl' is not properly sanitized."
