  "isVulnerable": true,

  "vulnerabilities": ["Denial of Service (DoS)"],
  "description": "The function does not properly handle cases where the 'content-length' header is missing or manipulated. An attacker could potentially send a large amount of data that exceeds the 'bytes' limit, causing the server to consume excessive resources and potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Additionally, the function does not validate the 'content-length' header, which could be manipulated by an attacker to bypass the limit check."
