  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the use of innerHTML property in several places, which allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through the input that is directly used in the innerHTML property. This can lead to various attacks such as stealing sensitive information, performing actions on behalf of the user, or spreading malware."
