  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function unique_name_241 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly concatenates the input 'value' into the HTML string without any sanitization or encoding. An attacker could inject malicious scripts by providing a 'value' that includes script tags, which would then be executed in the context of the user's browser when the generated HTML is rendered."
