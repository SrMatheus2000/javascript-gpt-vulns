  "description": "The function parseAssignment does not perform any input validation, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the input is not as expected. For example, if 'token' or 'node' is null or undefined, the function will throw an error. Additionally, the function does not check if 'node.args' is an array before calling 'forEach' on it, which could lead to a TypeError if 'node.args' is not an array. This could be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service by crashing the application. The function should include checks to ensure that the input is valid and of the expected type."
