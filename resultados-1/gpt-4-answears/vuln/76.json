  "vulnerabilities": ["Command Injection", "Argument Injection", "SQL Injection"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection because it uses the exec function to execute a shell command without properly sanitizing the input. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. Additionally, the function does not properly sanitize the output before appending it to the shares array, which could lead to argument injection or SQL injection if the output is used in a SQL query or as an argument to another command."
