  "description": "The function unique_name_600 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly inserts user-provided 'data' into the innerHTML of an element. If 'data' contains malicious JavaScript code, it will be executed when the HTML is rendered. This can lead to various security issues, such as stealing user data or performing actions on behalf of the user."
