  "vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection", "Path Traversal", "Information Exposure Through an Error Message"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection because it concatenates user-supplied input into a command that is executed synchronously by the system. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. The function also uses user-supplied input to construct a file path, making it vulnerable to path traversal attacks. Additionally, the function logs the command to the console, which could expose sensitive information in an error message."
