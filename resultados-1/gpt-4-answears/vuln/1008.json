  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function 'writeErr' is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly includes user input (data.query.jsonp and message) in the response without proper sanitization or encoding. An attacker could exploit this by injecting malicious scripts as part of the 'jsonp' or 'message' parameters, which would then be executed in the context of the user's browser when the response is received."
