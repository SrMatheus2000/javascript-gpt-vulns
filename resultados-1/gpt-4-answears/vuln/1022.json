  "vulnerabilities": ["Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks. This is because it uses user input directly in a regular expression without any sanitization or rate limiting. An attacker could provide a specially crafted input that takes a long time to evaluate, causing the server to become unresponsive. This is a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The function also does not validate the input before using it, which could lead to other types of attacks."
