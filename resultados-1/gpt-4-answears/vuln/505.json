  "description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the 'name' input, which could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the input includes malicious scripts. The function also does not properly handle the type of the 'name' input, which could lead to type confusion vulnerabilities. Additionally, the function does not properly escape or encode the 'font' output, which could lead to further XSS vulnerabilities if the 'font' output is used in a context that interprets it as code."
