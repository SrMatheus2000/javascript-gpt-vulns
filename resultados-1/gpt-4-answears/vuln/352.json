  "": "The function 'unique_name_163' is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that it directly includes user input (markup, theme, options) in the output HTML without proper sanitization or encoding. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through these inputs, which would then be executed in the context of the user's browser when the generated HTML is rendered. This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
