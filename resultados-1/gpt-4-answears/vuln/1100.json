  "description": "The function is vulnerable to path traversal attacks (CWE-22) because it uses user input to construct a file path without properly sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete files outside of the intended directory. The function is also vulnerable to external control of file name or path (CWE-73) because it uses user input to construct a file path without properly validating it. This could allow an attacker to control the name or path of a file. The function is vulnerable to code injection (CWE-94) because it uses user input to construct a command without properly sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The function is vulnerable to resource management errors (CWE-99) because it does not properly manage resources, which could lead to denial of service or other impacts."
