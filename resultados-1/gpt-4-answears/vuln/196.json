  "description": "The function is intended to sanitize sensitive data such as 'password' or 'secret' from the error response. However, it only checks for these keywords in a case-insensitive manner. If the keys are not in English or are obfuscated, they will not be sanitized. Additionally, the function does not handle nested objects, so if the sensitive data is within a nested object, it will not be sanitized. This could potentially lead to information exposure."
