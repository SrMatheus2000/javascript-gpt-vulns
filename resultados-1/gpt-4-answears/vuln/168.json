  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it does not validate or sanitize the 'filepath' input, which could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system. It also does not handle exceptions properly (CWE-706), as it throws an error without catching it, which could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Additionally, it does not limit the size of the file being read (CWE-400), which could lead to excessive resource consumption if an attacker provides a very large file."
