  "description": "The function 'unique_name_39' is vulnerable to code injection. It takes a string as input and directly uses it to create a new instance of 'tree.Anonymous'. If the input string is an instance of 'tree.JavaScript', it is evaluated without any sanitization. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code."
