  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. It allows a wide range of HTML, SVG, and MathML tags and attributes, which can be exploited to inject malicious scripts. Although it attempts to sanitize the input, it does not properly encode or escape the output, which can lead to XSS vulnerabilities. For example, it does not properly handle cases where an attribute value contains a script, which can be executed when the sanitized HTML is rendered. Additionally, it does not properly handle cases where the input contains clobbered elements, which can be used to bypass the sanitization process."
