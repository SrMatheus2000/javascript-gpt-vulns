  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'window.parent.db' variable is directly concatenated into the 'question' variable without any sanitization or encoding. If an attacker can control the value of 'window.parent.db', they can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of the victim's session. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or execution of arbitrary actions on the behalf of the user."
