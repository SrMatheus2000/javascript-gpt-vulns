  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Command Injection"],
  "description": "The function checkGraphvizInstalled takes a config object and uses the graphVizPath property to construct a command that is then executed. If an attacker can control the value of graphVizPath, they could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the system. This is a classic example of command injection vulnerability."
