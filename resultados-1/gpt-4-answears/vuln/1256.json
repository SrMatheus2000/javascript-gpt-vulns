  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-79", "CWE-20"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "Improper Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks because it directly uses user input in the HTML output without proper sanitization or encoding. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that can steal sensitive information or perform actions on behalf of the user. The function is also vulnerable to Improper Input Validation because it does not validate or sanitize the 'msg', 'url', and 'linenumber' parameters before using them, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors."
