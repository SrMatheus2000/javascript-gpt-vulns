  "description": "The function 'unique_name_31' is vulnerable to path traversal attacks because it uses user-supplied input in 'child.entryName' to construct a file path without properly sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete files outside of the intended directory. Additionally, the function uses 'Utils.writeFileTo', which can be potentially dangerous if the content and file path are not properly validated and sanitized."
