  "description": "The function unique_name_229 is vulnerable to OS command injection. This is because it uses the 'dir' parameter directly in a command that is executed by the system. An attacker could potentially manipulate the 'dir' parameter to execute arbitrary commands on the system. This is a serious security risk that could lead to full system compromise. The vulnerability corresponds to CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')."
