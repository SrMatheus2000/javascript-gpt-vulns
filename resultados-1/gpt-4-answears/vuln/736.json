  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Open Redirect attacks because it does not validate the 'dest' variable which is derived from the user-supplied input '_url.hostname'. An attacker can manipulate the 'dest' variable to redirect users to malicious websites. The function also exposes sensitive information such as error details which can be exploited by an attacker to gain more information about the system. Additionally, the function does not limit the number of requests a user can make, making it susceptible to Denial of Service attacks."
