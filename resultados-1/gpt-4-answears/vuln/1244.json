  "description": "The provided JavaScript function does not appear to have any obvious vulnerabilities. It checks if the node is an instance of ObjectNode, checks if the property is safe before accessing it, and throws errors when encountering unexpected types or unsafe properties. This function seems to be well-protected against common JavaScript vulnerabilities such as type confusion, prototype pollution, and arbitrary property access."
