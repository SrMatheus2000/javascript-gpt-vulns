  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) because it uses user-supplied input to construct a file path in the 'processGet' function without properly validating or sanitizing the input. This could allow an attacker to access arbitrary files on the server. It is also vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79) because it does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before including it in the generated output. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code. Finally, it is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CWE-352) because it does not implement any CSRF protection mechanisms, allowing an attacker to trick a user into making an unintended request."
