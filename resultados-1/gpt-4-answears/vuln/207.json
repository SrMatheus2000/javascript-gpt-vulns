{
  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"],
  "description": "The function uses a regular expression (regex) to parse the input string. If the input string is not well-formed or is too long, the regex can take a very long time to evaluate, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. This is known as a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability. Additionally, the function does not properly validate the input before using it, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors."
