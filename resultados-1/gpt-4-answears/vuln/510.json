  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-79"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the use of 'innerHTML' or 'outerHTML' properties or 'document.write()' method which allows arbitrary content to be written into the page, including potentially malicious scripts. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser. The specific lines of code that make the function vulnerable are not provided in the question, but the description of the vulnerability is accurate."
