  "description": "The function uses a custom cryptographic function which is generally considered insecure. Cryptography is a complex field and it's recommended to use well-tested libraries instead of custom solutions. The function also uses Math.random() for generating random numbers which is not cryptographically secure and can lead to predictable outputs."
