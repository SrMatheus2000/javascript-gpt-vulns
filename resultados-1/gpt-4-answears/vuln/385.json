  "description": "The function unique_name_186 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly inserts the 'email' and 'text' parameters into the HTML without any form of sanitization or encoding. An attacker could potentially provide a malicious string for these parameters, which would then be executed when the resulting HTML is rendered in a user's browser."
