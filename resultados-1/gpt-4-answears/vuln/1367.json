  "description": "The function is vulnerable to path traversal attacks because it concatenates a user-controlled input (filePath) directly into a file path which is then used to create directories and extract files. An attacker could manipulate the filePath to overwrite arbitrary files or create directories outside of the intended path. Additionally, the function sets insecure default permissions (0777) which allows any user to read, write, and execute the files."
