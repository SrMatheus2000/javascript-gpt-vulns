  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection"],
  "description": "The function unique_name_140 is vulnerable to code injection. The 'options' parameter is directly concatenated into a command string without any sanitization or escaping. This means that if a user can control the 'options' parameter, they can inject arbitrary commands to be executed."
