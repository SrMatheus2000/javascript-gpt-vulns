  "description": "The function unique_name_784 is vulnerable to OS command injection. The 'dir' parameter is directly concatenated into the command string without any sanitization or escaping. This means that if a user can control the 'dir' parameter, they can inject arbitrary commands to be executed on the server. This is a serious security issue that can lead to full server compromise."
