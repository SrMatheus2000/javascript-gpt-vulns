  "description": "The function uses the 'rsa-sha256' algorithm by default if no algorithm is provided in the options. This algorithm is considered weak and can be vulnerable to attacks. It is recommended to use a stronger algorithm like 'rsa-sha512'. Also, the function does not validate the 'keyId' and 'key' provided in the options. If these values are not properly validated, it can lead to security vulnerabilities."
