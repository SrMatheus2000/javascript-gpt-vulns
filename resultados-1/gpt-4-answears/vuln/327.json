It is using promises and callbacks correctly, and it is not using any dangerous functions or methods that could lead to common vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, or Remote Code Execution. However, without the context of the rest of the application, it's impossible to say for certain that there are no vulnerabilities."
