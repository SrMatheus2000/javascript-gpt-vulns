  "description": "The function setupPostMessage() is vulnerable because it does not validate the origin of the received message. This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if an attacker can trick a user into opening a malicious website while the user is logged into the target site. Additionally, the function does not properly validate the input data before processing it, which can lead to code injection attacks. An attacker could potentially send a specially crafted message that could execute arbitrary code in the context of the user's session."
