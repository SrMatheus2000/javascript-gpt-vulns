  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "Improper Output Neutralization for Logs"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function does not properly sanitize user input, allowing for potential script injection. For example, the function 'htmlToData' directly uses user input without sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that would be executed when the page is loaded. Additionally, the function 'updateHtml' does not properly neutralize output for logs, which could lead to information disclosure or other potential attacks."
