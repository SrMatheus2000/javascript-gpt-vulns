  "description": "The function does not seem to validate or sanitize the request headers, which can lead to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) if an attacker can trick a victim into making a request to the server. Additionally, the function does not validate the 'if-none-match' and 'if-modified-since' headers, which can lead to Improper Input Validation vulnerability if an attacker can manipulate these headers to bypass cache controls or to cause the server to return incorrect responses."
