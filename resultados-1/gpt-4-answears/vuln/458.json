  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal attacks (CWE-22). The vulnerability exists because the function uses user-supplied input in 'req.urlBase' to construct a filesystem path used in 'fs.existsSync' and 'fs.statSync' calls. An attacker can manipulate 'req.urlBase' to navigate the filesystem outside of the intended directory, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive files."
