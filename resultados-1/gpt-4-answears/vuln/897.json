  "CWEs": ["CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE-200: Information Exposure", "CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Sensitive data exposure", "Insecure storage of API keys", "Use of deprecated Buffer constructor"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable as it uses the deprecated Buffer constructor, which can lead to security vulnerabilities if not used properly. It also exposes sensitive information by converting the API key to base64, which can be easily decoded. The API key should be stored securely and not exposed. Additionally, the function does not use a salt with the one-way hash, making it more susceptible to dictionary and rainbow table attacks."
