  "description": "The function unique_name_597 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that it directly uses the 'selector' parameter in the jQuery.parseHTML function without properly sanitizing it first. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through the 'selector' parameter, which would then be executed when the HTML is parsed."
