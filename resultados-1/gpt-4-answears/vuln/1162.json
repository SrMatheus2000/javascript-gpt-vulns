  "description": "The function unique_name_664 does not validate the input for the 'locale' and 'phrase' parameters in the routes. This could lead to an SQL Injection if the i18nRoutes.i18n and i18nRoutes.translate methods are not properly handling these parameters. Also, the function does not check if the configObject is an object, which could lead to unexpected behavior if a non-object is passed."
