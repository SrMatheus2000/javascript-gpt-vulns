  "vulnerabilities": ["Null Pointer Dereference", "Improper Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function does not properly validate the input. It assumes that the properties of obj1 and obj2 are always defined and can lead to a null pointer dereference if they are not. This can cause the application to crash. Additionally, the function does not validate the type of obj1 and obj2. If they are not objects, the function will throw a TypeError when trying to access their properties."
