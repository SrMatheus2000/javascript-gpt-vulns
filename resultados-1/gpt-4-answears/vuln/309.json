  "description": "The function diskusage is vulnerable to command injection because it concatenates a user-supplied path directly into a command that is executed by the system. An attacker could provide a path that includes command line syntax, which would be executed by the system. Although the function checks for double quotes in the path, it does not check for other special characters or sequences that could be used to inject commands. For example, an attacker could use backticks (`), $(...), or other command substitution syntax to inject commands."
