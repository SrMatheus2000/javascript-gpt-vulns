  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input in 'fileName' to access files. An attacker can manipulate 'fileName' to read arbitrary files on the system. Additionally, it is also vulnerable to Information Exposure (CWE-200) as it reveals detailed error messages that could provide an attacker with useful information about the system."
