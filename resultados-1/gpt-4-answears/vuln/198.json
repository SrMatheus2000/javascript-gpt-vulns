  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it reads files directly from the filesystem without validating the input filename, which could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files. It also exposes sensitive information (CWE-200) by revealing the structure of the configuration file and potentially sensitive default values. Error messages (CWE-209) could also expose sensitive information about the system. The function could also be vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack (CWE-400) as it does not limit the size of the file being read, potentially leading to excessive resource consumption."
