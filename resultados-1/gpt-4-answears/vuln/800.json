  "vulnerabilities": ["Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"],
  "description": "The function uses several regular expressions to test the input. If the input is a long string, it can cause the application to hang due to excessive backtracking, a situation known as Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). This can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending a specially crafted input that takes a long time to process."
