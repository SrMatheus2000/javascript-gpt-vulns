  "vulnerabilities": ["Infinite Loop", "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "Improper Input Validation"],
  "description": "The function unique_name_91 has a potential vulnerability of entering into an infinite loop if the 'digest' function always returns true. This can lead to uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) and can cause the application to hang or crash. Additionally, there is no validation of the input parameters 'configObj' and 'envObj', which can lead to improper input validation (CWE-20). Malicious users can pass in harmful data to exploit this vulnerability."
