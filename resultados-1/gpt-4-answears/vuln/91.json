  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Code Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The code uses the Function constructor to dynamically generate and execute code from a string, which is obtained from the HTML of a webpage. This can lead to Code Injection if an attacker can control the content of the webpage. Additionally, the function directly inserts HTML content into the page without sanitizing it, which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if the HTML content contains malicious scripts."
