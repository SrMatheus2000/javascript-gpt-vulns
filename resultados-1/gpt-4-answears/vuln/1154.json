  "description": "The function is vulnerable as it exposes the session ID in the Set-Cookie header which can be intercepted and used for session hijacking. It also allows session fixation as it sets a new session ID without invalidating the old one. The session expiration is set to a year which is a long period and can lead to session hijacking if the session ID is compromised."
