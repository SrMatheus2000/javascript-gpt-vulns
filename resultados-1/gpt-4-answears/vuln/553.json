  "description": "The function '_getPasteContent' is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. It takes the content from the clipboard and directly inserts it into the HTML of the page without sanitizing it. This means that if the clipboard content contains malicious scripts, they will be executed in the context of the page. This can lead to various security issues such as stealing sensitive data, session hijacking, defacement of the website, etc."
