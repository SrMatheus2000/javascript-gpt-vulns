  "description": "The function downloads a file from a URL using HTTP, not HTTPS, which means the data is transmitted in clear text and can be intercepted by attackers (CWE-311, CWE-319). The function also does not limit the size of the file being downloaded, which could lead to resource exhaustion (CWE-400). Additionally, the function lacks proper error handling for the 'fs.readFile' function, which could lead to unhandled exceptions."
