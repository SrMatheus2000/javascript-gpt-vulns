  "description": "The function 'unique_name_317' is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input in 'tElement.html()' without properly sanitizing it. An attacker can inject malicious scripts as input, which will then be executed in the browser of any user viewing the page. This can lead to a variety of attacks such as stealing user's cookies, performing actions on behalf of the user, or even delivering malware. The vulnerability corresponds to CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')."
