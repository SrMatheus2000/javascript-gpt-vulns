  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input in file paths without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to read or overwrite arbitrary files. It also sets incorrect default permissions (CWE-276) which can expose sensitive information to unauthorized users. Additionally, it uses potentially dangerous functions (CWE-676) such as fs.writeFile and fs.chmod which can lead to security vulnerabilities if not used carefully."
