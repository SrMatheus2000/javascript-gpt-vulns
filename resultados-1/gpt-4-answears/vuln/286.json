  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function takes user input from the 'data-ytparams' attribute and directly injects it into the HTML content without proper sanitization or encoding. An attacker could inject malicious scripts through this attribute, which would then be executed in the context of the user's browser. This could lead to various harmful actions such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
