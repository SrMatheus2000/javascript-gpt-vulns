  "description": "The function unique_name_341 is vulnerable to both Code Injection and Path Traversal attacks. The 'name' parameter is directly concatenated into the require statement without any sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to potentially load and execute arbitrary code (Code Injection) or access files outside of the intended directory (Path Traversal)."
