  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-79"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function takes an input 'd' and uses it to create HTML elements without properly sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, which would then be executed in the context of the victim's browser. The vulnerability is specifically in the 'match' and 'extra.match' methods where the input 'd' is directly used without any sanitization. An attacker could provide a string that includes a script tag with malicious JavaScript code."
