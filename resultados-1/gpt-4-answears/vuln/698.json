  "description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection because it directly uses the user input (req.body.email) in a database query without sanitizing it first. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the SQL query and gain unauthorized access to the database. Additionally, the function exposes sensitive information by sending detailed error messages to the client, which could provide an attacker with useful information. Lastly, the function does not handle session expiration, which could allow an attacker to use an old session to gain unauthorized access."
