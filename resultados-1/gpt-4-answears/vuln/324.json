  "description": "The function does not validate the input before using it. This can lead to various vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) where an attacker can trick a victim into executing unwanted actions on a web application in which they're authenticated. Also, the function does not handle errors properly. If an error occurs during the transaction signing process, it simply rejects with a generic error message, which can lead to information disclosure."
