  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. The regular expression used in the function can cause exponential backtracking on certain inputs, which can lead to a denial of service if an attacker provides a malicious input. This is due to the use of '+' and '*' quantifiers in the regular expression, which can cause a large number of backtracking steps. Additionally, the function does not validate the input 'identifiers', which can lead to unexpected behavior if an attacker provides an invalid input."
