  "description": "The function 'buildMiddleware' is vulnerable due to several reasons. Firstly, it uses weak authentication mechanism in the 'staticUsersAuthorizer' function where it compares username and password in a non-secure way which can lead to improper authentication (CWE-287). Secondly, the function exposes sensitive information such as username and password in the 'req.auth' object (CWE-359). Lastly, the function exposes information through error messages in the 'assert' statements which can provide valuable information to an attacker (CWE-209)."
