  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection"],
  "description": "The serialize function is vulnerable to code injection. This is because it directly converts input into strings that are evaluated as code. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code through the 'source' parameter, which would then be executed. This could lead to a variety of security issues, including remote code execution, data leakage, and denial of service."
