  "description": "The function 'unique_name_321' is vulnerable to SQL and NoSQL injection attacks. This is because it directly uses the 'where' parameter in constructing a database query without properly sanitizing or validating it. An attacker could potentially provide a malicious 'where' object that manipulates the query, leading to unauthorized access to data or other unintended behavior. Additionally, the function does not validate the 'model' parameter, which could lead to unexpected behavior if an invalid or malicious value is provided."
