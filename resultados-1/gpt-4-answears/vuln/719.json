  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) because it uses user input to construct a file path without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to access, read, or write files outside of the intended directory. It's also vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79) because it reflects user input in HTTP responses without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts. Additionally, it's vulnerable to SQL Injection (CWE-89) because it uses user input in a database query without proper sanitization or parameterization, allowing an attacker to manipulate the query."
