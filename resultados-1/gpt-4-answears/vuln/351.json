  "description": "The function seems to be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function takes an input (node.content) and directly uses it to generate HTML content without proper sanitization or encoding. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the generated HTML, leading to XSS attacks. The vulnerability corresponds to CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')."
