  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function unique_name_576 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it concatenates the 'rootID' variable directly into the HTML string without properly sanitizing it. If 'rootID' contains malicious scripts, it will be executed when the HTML is rendered in the browser. This can lead to various security issues such as stealing sensitive data, session hijacking, defacement of the website, etc."
