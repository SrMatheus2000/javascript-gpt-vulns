  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection"],
  "description": "The function 'unique_name_106' is vulnerable to code injection. This is due to the use of the 'interpolate' and 'nest' methods of the 'interpolator' object, which are used to parse and execute user-supplied data. If an attacker can control the 'options' parameter, they can inject malicious code that will be executed by the function. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including data theft, data corruption, and denial of service."
