  "description": "The function loadProject(name) is vulnerable to path traversal attacks. The function does not properly sanitize the 'name' parameter, which is used to construct a file path. An attacker could potentially manipulate the 'name' parameter to navigate the file system outside of the intended directory. This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete sensitive files on the server."
