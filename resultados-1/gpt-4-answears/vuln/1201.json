  "": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that user-supplied input (curr_table_name and curr_column_name) is being directly used in the construction of HTML content without proper sanitization or encoding. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through these inputs, which would then be executed in the context of the victim's browser when the generated HTML content is rendered."
