  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input to create HTML elements without properly sanitizing the input first. Specifically, the 'item.text' and 'item.title' values are directly appended to the HTML without any form of sanitization or encoding. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through these inputs, which would then be executed when the HTML is rendered in a user's browser."
