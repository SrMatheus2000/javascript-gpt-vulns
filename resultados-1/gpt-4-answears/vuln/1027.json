  "description": "The function does not handle the error 'err' returned by 'req.session.save'. This could lead to Information Exposure Through an Error Message (CWE-209) if any error information is returned. Additionally, the session is saved automatically when responding, which could potentially lead to Session Fixation (CWE-384) if an attacker is able to manipulate the session ID."
