  "description": "The function 'execCommit' is vulnerable to command injection. This is because it uses user-supplied input in 'args' and 'newVersion' directly in the 'runExec' function which executes shell commands. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands through these inputs, leading to arbitrary command execution on the server."
