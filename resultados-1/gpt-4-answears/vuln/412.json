  "": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it uses the .innerHTML method to insert user-controlled data (the 'text' variable) into the HTML document. If an attacker can control the value of 'text', they can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page, which will be executed when the page is loaded. This can lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
