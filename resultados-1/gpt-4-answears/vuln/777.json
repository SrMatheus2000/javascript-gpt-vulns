  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function does not properly sanitize user input for the 'href' attribute in the 'link' and 'autolink' cases of the 'htmlify' object. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts through the 'href' attribute, leading to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Although there is an attempt to replace 'javascript:' in the 'href' attribute, this is not sufficient to prevent all possible XSS attacks."
