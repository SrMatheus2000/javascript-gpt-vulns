  "description": "The provided JavaScript function does not appear to have any obvious vulnerabilities. It is simply iterating over a nodeList and pushing values into a valueList. It also handles 'SpreadElement' types and null values. However, without knowing the context in which this function is used or the definitions of the functions 'getStaticValueR', it's hard to definitively say there are no vulnerabilities."
