  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function setupGlobalExceptionHandler() is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user-supplied input (msg, url, linenumber) in the HTML output without properly sanitizing it. An attacker can inject malicious scripts in these inputs, which will be executed in the user's browser when the error message is displayed. This can lead to various attacks such as stealing sensitive information, session hijacking, defacement of the website, etc."
