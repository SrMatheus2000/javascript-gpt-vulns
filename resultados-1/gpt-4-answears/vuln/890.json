  "CWEs": ["CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Buffer Overflow"],
  "description": "The function '_allocate' is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. This is because it does not properly check the size of the input 'bytes' before allocating memory for the new buffer. If 'bytes' is larger than the maximum allowed buffer size, it can lead to a buffer overflow, which can cause the application to crash or potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code."
