  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection"],
  "description": "The function 'unique_name_454' is vulnerable to code injection. This is due to the use of the 'Function' constructor in the 'FunctionExpression' block. An attacker can potentially control the input to the 'Function' constructor, which can lead to arbitrary code execution."
