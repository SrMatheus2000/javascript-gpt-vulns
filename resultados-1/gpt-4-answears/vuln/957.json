  "isVulnerable": true,
  "CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-384: Session Fixation", "CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration"],
  "vulnerabilities": ["No validation of 'auth.credentials' and 'auth.artifacts'", "No session expiration handling", "Potential session fixation attack"],
  "description": "The function 'unique_name_513' is vulnerable as it does not validate 'auth.credentials' and 'auth.artifacts' before setting them. This could lead to potential security issues such as unauthorized access. Additionally, the function does not handle session expiration which could lead to session fixation attacks. The function also does not check if the 'auth' object exists before accessing its properties which could lead to potential null pointer exceptions."
