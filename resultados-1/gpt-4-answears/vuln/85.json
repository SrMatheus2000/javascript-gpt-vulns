  "description": "The function 'toast' is vulnerable to code injection. The 'message' parameter is directly embedded into a string that is then evaluated as code. If an attacker can control the 'message' parameter, they can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including data theft, data corruption, and denial of service."
