  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The user input is directly used in the 'item.innerHTML' without any sanitization or encoding, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts. The injected scripts can be executed in the user's browser, leading to various attacks such as cookie theft, account takeover, defacement of the website, etc."
