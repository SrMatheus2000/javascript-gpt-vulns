  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) because it uses user input from 'req.url' to construct a file path without proper sanitization. An attacker could manipulate 'req.url' to access files outside of the intended directory. The function is also vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) because it does not limit the size of the file that can be requested. An attacker could request a very large file, causing the server to consume excessive resources while trying to process the request."
