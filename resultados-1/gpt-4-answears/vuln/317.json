  "description": "This function is vulnerable to timing attacks. The time it takes to execute can vary based on the input, which can potentially reveal sensitive information. Specifically, the 'if (hBit != eBit)' condition can cause different execution paths and thus different timings. An attacker could potentially use this information to infer the secret key 'k'."
