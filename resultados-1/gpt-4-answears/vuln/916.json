  "description": "The function unique_name_485 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input (repo.username and repo.reponame) in the HTML content without proper sanitization or encoding. An attacker could inject malicious scripts by providing specially crafted values for repo.username or repo.reponame, which would then be executed in the context of the victim's session."
