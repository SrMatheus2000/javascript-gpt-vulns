  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. In the 'onData' event handler, it concatenates incoming data chunks directly to a string 'body'. If an attacker sends a large amount of data, it can cause the server to consume a lot of memory and CPU resources, leading to a DoS condition. This is known as a 'large payload' attack. The vulnerability is related to CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')."
