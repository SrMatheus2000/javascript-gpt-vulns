  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) because it uses user input to construct a file path without properly sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to access sensitive files outside of the intended directory. It's also vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79) because it serves files with user-controlled content without proper output encoding, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts. Lastly, it's vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) because it does not limit the number of concurrent connections, which could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack."
