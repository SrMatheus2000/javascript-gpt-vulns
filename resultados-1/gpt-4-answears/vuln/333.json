  "description": "The function signPersonalMessage is vulnerable due to the exposure of sensitive information and lack of input validation. The function does not validate the 'message' parameter before using it, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues. Additionally, the function exposes sensitive information such as the private key (hdPath) and the signature, which could be exploited by an attacker to impersonate the user or perform other malicious actions."
