  "description": "The function updateOptionsDropDown is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly concatenates the 'option.value' and 'option.label' into the HTML string without properly sanitizing or escaping them. If these values contain malicious scripts, they will be executed when the HTML is rendered in the browser."
