  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it directly injects the response from the server into the HTML DOM without proper sanitization or encoding. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, leading to various attacks such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) because it does not validate or check the origin of the request, allowing an attacker to trick a user into performing actions without their consent."
