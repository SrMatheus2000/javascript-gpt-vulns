  "description": "The function unique_name_41 appears to be vulnerable to command injection. This is due to the use of the spawn function with user-supplied input (self.cmdarg and type) without proper sanitization or validation. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands through these inputs, leading to arbitrary command execution on the server."
