  "vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
  "description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function uses the 'PMA_commonParams.get('table')' method to get the table name, which is then concatenated into a string that is used in the 'PMA_confirm' function. If an attacker can control the value of 'table', they could inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the context of the user's session. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or execution of arbitrary actions on the user's behalf."
