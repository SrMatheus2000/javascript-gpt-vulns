  "": "The provided JavaScript function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function uses a regular expression to replace all occurrences of SVG tags in the input string with an empty string. However, it does not properly sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SVG tags that can execute arbitrary code in the context of the user's browser."
