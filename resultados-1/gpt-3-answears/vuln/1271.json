  "description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection and path traversal attacks. The 'input' parameter is directly used in the command executed by 'exec' without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands. Additionally, the 'output' parameter is concatenated directly to the file path without proper validation, allowing an attacker to traverse the file system and potentially overwrite arbitrary files."
