  "description": "The function 'unique_name_624' is vulnerable to CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) and CWE-78 (OS Command Injection). The 'forwardResponse' function does not properly validate and sanitize the input before copying headers, which could lead to potential corruption of binary data. Additionally, the 'post', 'put', and 'head' functions do not properly validate and sanitize the input before creating a request, which could result in possible injection of untrusted data."
