  "description": "The function does not perform any input validation or boundary checks, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability (CWE-120). An attacker could potentially provide a length value that exceeds the size of the buffer, causing the copy operation to overwrite adjacent memory and potentially execute arbitrary code."
