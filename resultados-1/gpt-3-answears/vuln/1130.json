  "description": "The function is vulnerable to type confusion and insecure cryptographic storage. The function does not properly validate the type of the 'val' and 'secret' parameters, which can lead to type confusion vulnerabilities. Additionally, the function uses an insecure cryptographic storage method by comparing the result of 'exports.sign(mac, secret)' with 'exports.sign(val, secret)', which can be exploited to reveal the secret value."
