  "description": "This function has a vulnerability related to uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) and improper error handling (CWE-703). The function does not have any input validation or rate limiting mechanisms, which could lead to a denial of service attack by overwhelming the system with fatal errors. Additionally, the function catches all exceptions and logs them, but does not handle them properly, potentially exposing sensitive information in the error messages."
