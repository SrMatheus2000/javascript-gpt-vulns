  "description": "The code is vulnerable to command injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'createRequest' function does not properly sanitize user input before constructing the request object, which can lead to command injection. Additionally, the 'forwardResponse' function does not properly sanitize the response headers, which can lead to XSS attacks."
