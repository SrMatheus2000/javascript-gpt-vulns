"description": "The function unique_name_342 is vulnerable to Code Injection and Path Traversal attacks. The 'name' variable is directly concatenated into the require function, which can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or access files outside of the intended directory. This is a violation of CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') and CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')."
