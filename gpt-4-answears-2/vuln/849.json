"description": "The function sets the maximum number of listeners to 1000, which could potentially lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if an attacker is able to continuously open connections. This is because each new connection would consume system resources, and having too many open connections could exhaust these resources, leading to a DoS condition."
