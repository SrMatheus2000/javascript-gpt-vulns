"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-78"],
"vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection"],
"description": "The function createMuteOgg uses string concatenation to build a command that is then executed by child_process_1.exec. This can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands if they have control over the 'options' object. This is a classic example of OS Command Injection vulnerability."
