"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct file paths without proper validation or sanitization. It is also vulnerable to OS Command Injection (CWE-78) and Code Injection (CWE-94) as it uses user input to construct OS commands and code without proper validation or sanitization. The function is also vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) as it does not limit the number of redirects when downloading a file, which could lead to resource exhaustion."
