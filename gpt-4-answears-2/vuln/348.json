"description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection because it concatenates user-controlled input into a command that is executed by the system. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. The function is also vulnerable to argument injection because it uses user-controlled input in a command line argument. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the command line arguments. Finally, the function is vulnerable to path traversal because it uses user-controlled input in a file path without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access arbitrary files on the system."
