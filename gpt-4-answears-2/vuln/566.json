"description": "The function uses a regular expression (RegExp) to replace a password in a URI with asterisks. However, if the password is user-controlled and can be of arbitrary length, an attacker can craft a password that causes the regular expression to take a long time to evaluate, causing a Denial of Service (DoS). This is known as a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack."
