"description": "The function attempts to remove script tags from the input to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. However, this is not a reliable way to prevent XSS, as there are many ways to bypass this kind of filter. Additionally, the function does not properly escape output when inserting it into the HTML, which could lead to XSS if the input contains special characters. The function also catches and ignores all exceptions, which could hide errors and make debugging difficult."
