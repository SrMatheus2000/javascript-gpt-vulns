"isVulnerable": true,

"description": "The function is vulnerable to path traversal attacks. The function checks if the pathname contains '../', which is a common way to traverse directories, but it does not check for encoded versions of '../' such as '%2e%2e%2f'. An attacker could potentially access files outside of the intended directories by using such encoded strings."
