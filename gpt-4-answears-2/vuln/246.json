"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function takes a text input and directly uses it to set the innerHTML of a span element. Even though the function attempts to sanitize the input by replacing certain characters with their HTML encoded equivalents, it does not cover all possible ways an attacker could inject malicious scripts. For example, an attacker could use HTML entities or other encoding methods to bypass the sanitization."
