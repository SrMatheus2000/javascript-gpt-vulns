"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks because it directly uses user input in the HTML output without proper sanitization or escaping. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the browser of any user viewing the page. The function also does not validate the input properly, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors."
