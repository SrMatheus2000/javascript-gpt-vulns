"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function attempts to sanitize HTML input, but it does not properly handle all possible cases. For example, it does not properly handle cases where the input contains JavaScript code within HTML comments. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed by the victim's browser."
