"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input (req.url) directly to open a file without any validation. This could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server. It is also potentially vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79) as it sends the error message directly to the client without any sanitization, which could include script if the error message is manipulated."
