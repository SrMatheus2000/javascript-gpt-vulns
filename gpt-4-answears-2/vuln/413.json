It uses the 'path.normalize' and 'path.resolve' methods to handle directory paths, which are safe methods that do not introduce vulnerabilities. They resolve and normalize the specified path, eliminating '..' and '.' parts. Therefore, it does not have any Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) associated with it."
