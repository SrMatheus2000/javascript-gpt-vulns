"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-79", "CWE-20"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "Improper Validation"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it uses user input in the 'file.name' field directly in the HTML output without proper sanitization or encoding. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, leading to various types of attacks such as stealing sensitive data or performing actions on behalf of the user. Additionally, the function does not validate or sanitize the user input in the 'params' parameter, which could lead to other types of attacks or unexpected behavior."
