"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Denial of Service (DoS)", "Input Validation"],
"description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the 'options' input which can lead to vulnerabilities. An attacker can pass a large amount of data in 'options', causing the application to consume high resources (CPU, Memory), leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Additionally, the lack of input validation can lead to other vulnerabilities such as code injection or data leakage."
