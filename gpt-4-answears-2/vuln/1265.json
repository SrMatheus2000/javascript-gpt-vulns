"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Code Injection attacks. The function uses the decodeURIComponent function to decode user-supplied input, which can lead to XSS if the output is rendered in a web page without proper sanitization. Additionally, the function does not validate or sanitize the input before using it to build an object, which can lead to Code Injection attacks if an attacker can control the structure of the input."
