"isVulnerable": true,

"vulnerabilities": ["Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that it directly uses user input in the creation of HTML content (e.g., in the 'innerHTML' assignments). An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through the 'options' or 'playback' parameters, which could lead to unauthorized access or other security breaches."
