"description": "The function _wrapMatchesInNode is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it uses the innerHTML property to insert user-controlled data into the HTML document. If the _convertUrlsToLinks function does not properly sanitize the textNode.data input, an attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web page, which would then be executed in the context of the victim's browser."
