"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct a file path without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete files outside of the intended directory. It also exposes potentially sensitive information through error messages (CWE-209), which could be used by an attacker to gain more information about the system or application. Additionally, the function does not properly control the allocation of resources, leading to potential resource exhaustion (CWE-400)."
