"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Potential null pointer dereference", "No input validation"],
"description": "The function does not validate the input 'address' before using it. If a null or undefined value is passed, the function will throw an error when trying to execute the 'trimLeft' method or when trying to access the 'match' array. This could lead to unexpected behavior or application crashes. Additionally, the function does not check if the 'protocolre.exec(address)' operation was successful before accessing the 'match' array, which could lead to a null pointer dereference if the regular expression does not match the input string."
