"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-78", "CWE-88", "CWE-20"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Command Injection", "Argument Injection", "Improper Input Validation"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection because it concatenates user-supplied input into a command that is executed by the system. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands that will be executed with the same privileges as the process that executes the command. The function also does not validate or sanitize the input, which can lead to argument injection vulnerabilities."
