"description": "The function uses eval() which is a dangerous function, as it executes the code it's passed with the privileges of the caller. If you run eval() with a string that could be affected by a malicious party, you may end up running malicious code on the user's machine with the permissions of your webpage / extension. In this case, the function template() takes a user input and directly uses it in eval() without any sanitization, which can lead to code injection attacks."
