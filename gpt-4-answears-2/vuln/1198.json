"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-79", "CWE-352"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it uses the 'window.parent.db' variable in the 'DROP DATABASE' command without proper sanitization or encoding, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts. It is also vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) because it does not implement any anti-CSRF tokens or similar mechanisms to ensure that the request is made intentionally by the user."
