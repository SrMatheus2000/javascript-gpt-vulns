"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function uses jQuery's .text() method to get the text of each option in a select element and pushes it into an array. If an attacker can control the text of these options, they could inject malicious scripts that would be executed when the array is used. This is a form of Stored XSS attack. The function does not sanitize or escape the text before using it, making it vulnerable to this type of attack."
