"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-78", "CWE-20"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Command Injection", "Improper Input Validation"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection because it directly includes user input in a command that is executed by the system. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. The function also does not validate the input from the user, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors."
