"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-676", "CWE-400"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "Use of Potentially Dangerous Function"],
"description": "The function uses the 'new Buffer' constructor, which is deprecated and potentially unsafe, leading to security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow.
