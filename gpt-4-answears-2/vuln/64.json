"description": "The provided JavaScript function does not appear to have any obvious security vulnerabilities. It is primarily defining and extending language syntax for a Prism syntax highlighter. There is no direct user input being processed or insecure API usage, which are common sources of vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is unlikely to be susceptible to common web vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, or Command Injection."
