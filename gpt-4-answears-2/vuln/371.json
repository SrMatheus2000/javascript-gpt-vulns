"vulnerabilities": ["Information Exposure Through Sent Data", "Path Traversal", "Code Injection"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Information Exposure Through Sent Data as it logs sensitive data such as tokens and environment variables. It is also vulnerable to Path Traversal as it uses user-supplied input to construct file paths without proper validation or sanitization. Additionally, it is vulnerable to Code Injection as it uses user-supplied input in the 'execSync' function which can lead to arbitrary command execution."
