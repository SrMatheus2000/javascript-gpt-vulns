"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct a file path without proper validation or sanitization. It is also vulnerable to OS Command Injection (CWE-78) as it uses user input in a command that is executed by the system. Code Injection (CWE-94) is possible as the function uses user input in a code that is executed by the system. The function is also vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) as it does not limit the number of recursive calls to the 'attemptDownload' function, which could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack."
