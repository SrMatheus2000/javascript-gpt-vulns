{
"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-200: Information Exposure", "CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Timing Attack", "Potential Buffer Overflow"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to timing attacks as it uses the 'crypto.timingSafeEqual' function which can allow an attacker to guess the value of a secret string by measuring the time it takes to compare the strings. Additionally, the function uses 'bufferAlloc' which can potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the length of the input strings is not properly validated."
