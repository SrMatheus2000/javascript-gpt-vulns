"description": "The function is vulnerable to several issues. First, it does not validate the input 'remoteUrl' which can lead to various attacks such as SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery). Second, it exposes sensitive information through error messages which can be exploited by an attacker to gain more information about the system. Third, it does not handle exceptions properly which can lead to information exposure. Lastly, it does not control the size of the request body which can lead to resource consumption and potential Denial of Service (DoS) attacks."
