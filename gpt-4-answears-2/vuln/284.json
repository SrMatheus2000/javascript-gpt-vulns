"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-79"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function embeds user-supplied input into HTML without properly sanitizing or encoding it. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the web page, which would be executed in the context of the victim's browser. The vulnerability is present in the 'embedVimeoIframe' and 'embedYoutubeIframe' functions where the 'id' and 'vimeoParams'/'youtubeParams' variables, which can be controlled by the user, are directly embedded into the HTML code."
