"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) because it uses user-supplied input in 'request.url' to construct a file path without properly sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to access arbitrary files on the server. It is also vulnerable to Information Exposure (CWE-200) because it reveals detailed error messages (including potentially sensitive system information) to the client in the event of a file read error."
