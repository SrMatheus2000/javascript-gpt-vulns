"description": "The function seems to be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function uses the Mustache.render method to render templates, which can lead to XSS if user-controlled data is not properly sanitized. Additionally, the function uses the jQuery html() method, which can also lead to XSS if the input is not properly sanitized. The function does not appear to sanitize the input before using it in these methods."
