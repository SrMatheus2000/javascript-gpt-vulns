"vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection"],
"description": "The function unique_name_445 is vulnerable to OS command injection. The 'host' parameter is directly concatenated into the command string without any sanitization or escaping, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. This is a serious security issue that can lead to full system compromise."
