"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
"description": "The function does not properly validate the input 's'. If 's' contains malicious scripts, it could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function only checks if 's' is a string and does not sanitize the input to remove or escape special characters that can be interpreted as code. Furthermore, the constants (HCHARS, AMP, LT, GT, QUOT, SQUOT) used in the function are not defined within the function, which could potentially lead to ReferenceError."
