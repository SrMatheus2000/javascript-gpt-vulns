"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection"],
"description": "The function 'unique_name_677' is vulnerable to code injection. It takes an input 'src' and directly passes it to the 'Function' constructor. This allows for arbitrary code execution if a user can control the 'src' input. This is a serious security risk as it can lead to a variety of attacks such as data theft, data corruption, denial of service, etc."
