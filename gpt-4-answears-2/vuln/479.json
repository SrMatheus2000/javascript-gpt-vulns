"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) because it uses user-supplied input in 'this.request.path' to construct a file path without proper sanitization. An attacker could manipulate 'requestPath' to access arbitrary files on the system. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79) because it directly uses user-supplied input in 'this.request.path' without proper output encoding when constructing the response body. An attacker could inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the user's browser."
