"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct a file path without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access arbitrary files on the system. It is also vulnerable to Information Exposure (CWE-200) as it logs sensitive information such as the request method, URL, and response status code, which could be exploited to gain further information about the system or its users."
