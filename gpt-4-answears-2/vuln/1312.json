"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'innerHTML' property is used to write the 'firstLine' variable directly into 'firstDiv' without proper sanitization or escaping. If 'firstLine' contains malicious script, it will be executed when the HTML is rendered. This can lead to various attacks such as stealing user's cookies or performing actions on behalf of the user."
