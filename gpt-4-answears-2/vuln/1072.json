"description": "The function seems to be vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. It takes a 'selector' parameter and uses it to create HTML without properly sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, which would then be executed in the context of the victim's browser."
