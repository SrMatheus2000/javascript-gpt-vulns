"vulnerabilities": ["Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)", "Insufficient Session Expiration", "Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards"],
"description": "The function staticUsersAuthorizer is vulnerable because it uses a simple comparison operator (==) instead of a strict comparison operator (===). This could lead to type coercion issues and potentially allow unauthorized access. Additionally, the function does not implement any form of session management or expiration, which could lead to session hijacking. The function also does not validate or sanitize the username and password inputs, which could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or SQL Injection attacks. Furthermore, the function does not hash or encrypt the passwords, which is a serious security risk."
