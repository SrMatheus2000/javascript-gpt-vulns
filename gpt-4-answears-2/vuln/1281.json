"vulnerabilities": ["Prototype Pollution"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. The function does not prevent the modification of the Object prototype. An attacker could use this to add or modify an existing property that will exist on all objects. This could potentially lead to JavaScript execution through other code that reads the polluted property. The function also does not handle null values properly, which could lead to a NULL Pointer Dereference."
