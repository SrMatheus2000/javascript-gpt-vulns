"CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks. The regular expression used in the function can cause exponential backtracking on certain inputs, which can lead to a denial of service if an attacker provides a malicious input. This is due to the use of the '+' and '*' quantifiers in the regular expression, which can cause the regular expression engine to consume a large amount of resources when backtracking. This is a type of Improper Input Validation (CWE-20) and can lead to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)."
