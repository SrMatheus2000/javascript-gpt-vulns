"description": "The function does not properly validate or sanitize the input, which can lead to vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Code Injection. The function uses the decodeURIComponent function, which can decode URI special characters, potentially leading to script injection if the output is rendered in an HTML context. Additionally, the function does not properly handle arrays and objects, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the input is not properly validated."
