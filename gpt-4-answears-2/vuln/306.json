"vulnerabilities": ["Unvalidated input", "Improper origin validation"],
"description": "The function getOriginOfRequest does not validate the origin or referrer from the request. This could allow an attacker to manipulate these values and potentially lead to security vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) or other attacks. The function also does not validate the protocol and host parsed from the referrer, which could lead to similar vulnerabilities."
