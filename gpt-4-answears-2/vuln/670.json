"description": "The function is vulnerable to JSON Injection because it parses user-supplied input without proper validation. This can lead to various types of attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Server-Side JavaScript Injection (SSJI), and Denial of Service (DoS). The function also does not limit the size of the parsed JSON, which can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by consuming all available memory."
