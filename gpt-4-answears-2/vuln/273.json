"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')", "CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)", "Improper Input Validation"],
"description": "The function uses a regular expression (regex) to parse a string, which can lead to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) if the regex is not properly designed and the input string is maliciously crafted. This can cause the application to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service. Additionally, the function does not validate the input string before processing it, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors."
