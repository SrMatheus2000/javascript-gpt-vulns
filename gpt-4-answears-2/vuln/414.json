"vulnerabilities": ["Path Traversal", "Unvalidated Input"],
"description": "The function does not validate the 'repoDir' parameter, which is used to construct a file path. This could lead to a path traversal vulnerability if an attacker can control the 'repoDir' parameter. Additionally, the function does not validate the 'options' parameter, which could lead to other vulnerabilities if an attacker can control the 'options' object."
