"description": "The function _removeCodeblockFirstLine is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the use of innerHTML property on the 'firstDiv' element, which can interpret any HTML and JavaScript code included in the input string. If the 'sanitizeHtmlCode' function does not properly sanitize the 'firstLine' input, malicious scripts could be executed in the user's browser."
