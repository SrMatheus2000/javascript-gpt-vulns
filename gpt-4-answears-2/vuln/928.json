"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-200: Information Exposure", "CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Sensitive data exposure", "Insecure Direct Object References"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable as it exposes sensitive information such as 'client_id' and 'client_secret' in the URL query string. This can lead to information leakage if the URL is logged or cached. Also, the function does not validate or sanitize the 'opts' input, which can lead to Insecure Direct Object References if the 'opts' object properties are referencing system-level resources."
