"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-200: Information Exposure", "CWE-310: Cryptographic Issues"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Timing Attack", "Information Disclosure"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to timing attacks as it uses the 'crypto.timingSafeEqual' function which can lead to information disclosure. An attacker can measure the time it takes to compare the strings and use this information to guess the string values. Additionally, the function does not validate the input, which can lead to other potential vulnerabilities."
