"description": "The function takes an HTML string, processes it, and returns a serialized string representation of the processed HTML. However, it does not sanitize the input HTML string, which could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if the input HTML string contains malicious scripts. This is a common vulnerability in web applications that do not properly sanitize user inputs."
