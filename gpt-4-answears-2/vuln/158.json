"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-79", "CWE-352"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it uses user input in the 'state' parameter directly without proper sanitization or encoding, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts. It is also vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) because it does not implement any anti-CSRF mechanisms, such as CSRF tokens, allowing an attacker to trick a victim into performing actions without their consent."
