"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-78"],
"vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection"],
"description": "The function addRemote is vulnerable to OS command injection because it concatenates user-supplied input into a command that is executed without proper sanitization or validation. An attacker could exploit this by providing a specially crafted input that includes shell metacharacters, potentially leading to arbitrary command execution."
