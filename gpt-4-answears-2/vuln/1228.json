"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
"vulnerabilities": ["SQL Injection", "No Input Validation"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection because it directly uses the 'padId' in a database query without any form of sanitization or parameterization. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the SQL query to gain unauthorized access to data or perform other malicious activities. Additionally, there is no input validation performed on the 'padId' before it is used in the function, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors."
