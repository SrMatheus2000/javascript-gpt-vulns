"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct a file path without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to access or overwrite arbitrary files. It's also vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79) as it reflects user input in HTTP responses without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts. Additionally, it's vulnerable to SQL Injection (CWE-89) as it uses user input in a database query without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate the query."
