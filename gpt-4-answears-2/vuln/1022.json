"description": "The function unique_name_560 has a couple of vulnerabilities. First, it does not validate the input for 'key' and 'value', which can lead to unexpected behavior or even security issues (CWE-20). Second, the function uses regular expressions which can lead to excessive consumption of resources (CPU and memory) if the input is not properly controlled, leading to a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack (CWE-400)."
