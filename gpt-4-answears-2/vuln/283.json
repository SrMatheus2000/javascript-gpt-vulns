"description": "The function embedYoutubeIframe is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input (youtubeParams) in the creation of an iframe without properly sanitizing it. An attacker could inject malicious scripts through the 'data-ytparams' attribute, which would then be executed when the iframe is loaded."
