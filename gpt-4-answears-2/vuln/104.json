"description": "The function is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution which is a type of attack that occurs when an attacker is able to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. This can lead to a variety of application-level vulnerabilities including Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, or even Cross-Site Scripting. In this function, the object properties are directly set without any type checking or validation, which can lead to modification of the object prototype."
