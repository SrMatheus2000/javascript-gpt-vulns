"vulnerabilities": ["Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)", "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) and Uncontrolled Resource Consumption. The function uses regular expressions in a way that can cause significant performance issues (ReDoS) if the input is not properly sanitized. Additionally, the function does not control the amount of resources (memory, CPU, etc.) used when processing input, leading to potential resource exhaustion."
