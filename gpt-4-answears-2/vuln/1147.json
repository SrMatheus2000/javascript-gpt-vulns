{
"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Insecure use of 'Buffer'"],
"description": "The function uses the 'Buffer' constructor, which is considered insecure because it can lead to various security issues if not used properly. If the 'value' parameter can be controlled by an attacker, it can lead to several types of attacks such as remote code execution or denial of service. It's recommended to use 'Buffer.from()', 'Buffer.alloc()', or 'Buffer.allocUnsafe()' instead."
