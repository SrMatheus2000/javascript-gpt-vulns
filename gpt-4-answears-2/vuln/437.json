"description": "The function is vulnerable to information disclosure as it exposes detailed error messages which can be exploited by an attacker to gain more information about the system. It also has a potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability as it does not control the consumption of resources in case of an error, which can lead to the exhaustion of system resources."
