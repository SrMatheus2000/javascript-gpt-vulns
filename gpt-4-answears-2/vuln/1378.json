"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct a file path without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete files outside of the intended directory. It is also vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (CWE-94) as it downloads a file from a URL that is constructed using user input without proper validation. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) as it does not limit the size of the file being downloaded, which could lead to a denial of service."
