"description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the 'results' and 'next' inputs, which could lead to vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection if the inputs contain malicious SQL commands. The function also exposes user information without checking if the user has the necessary permissions, leading to potential privacy violations. Furthermore, the function does not escape or sanitize the 'postData.topic.title', which could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if the title contains malicious scripts."
