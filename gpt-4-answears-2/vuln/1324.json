"description": "The function 'unique_name_770' is vulnerable to OS command injection. The function uses the 'exec' function to execute a command that is constructed using user-supplied input ('compassOptions'). An attacker could potentially inject malicious OS commands via the 'options' parameter, which could lead to arbitrary command execution on the server."
