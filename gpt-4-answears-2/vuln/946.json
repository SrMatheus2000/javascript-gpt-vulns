"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) because it uses user input to construct a file path without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access, read, or modify files outside of the intended directory. The function is also vulnerable to Information Exposure (CWE-200) because it reveals system-specific file paths in error messages, which could provide useful information to an attacker."
