"vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it uses user input directly in the construction of HTML content (curr_table_name and curr_column_name). This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the context of the victim's session. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) because it does not validate or verify the origin of the request in the AJAX call, allowing an attacker to trick a victim into executing unwanted actions in a web application in which they're authenticated."
