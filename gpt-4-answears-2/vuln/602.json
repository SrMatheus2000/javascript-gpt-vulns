"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input in file paths without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to read or write files outside of the intended directories. It is also vulnerable to OS Command Injection (CWE-78) as it uses user-supplied input in a command that is executed by the system. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. Lastly, the function uses a hard-coded password (CWE-259), which could be discovered and exploited by an attacker."
