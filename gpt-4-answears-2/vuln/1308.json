"description": "The function is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks because it concatenates incoming data chunks directly without any size limit, which can lead to excessive memory consumption if an attacker sends a large amount of data. It also allows Path Traversal attacks because it uses user-provided input to access file system resources without proper validation or sanitization, which can lead to unauthorized access to files. Additionally, the function does not validate or sanitize user-provided input before using it to construct keys and filenames, which can lead to various attacks such as code injection or data corruption."
