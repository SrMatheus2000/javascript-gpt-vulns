"description": "The function does not properly sanitize the input, which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if the output is rendered in HTML without proper escaping. The function also uses JavaScript's loose equality operator '==' instead of the strict equality operator '===', which can lead to unexpected type coercion and potentially incorrect results."
