It is primarily performing date and time calculations and manipulations, and does not interact with user input, the DOM, or other potentially risky APIs. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to common web security issues such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), or SQL Injection."
