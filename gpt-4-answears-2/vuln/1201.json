"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that user input is directly used in the construction of HTML content without proper sanitization or encoding. Specifically, the 'curr_table_name' and 'curr_column_name' variables are directly used in the construction of the 'question' variable, which is then used as part of the HTML content. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts by manipulating the 'table' and 'column' names, leading to various types of attacks such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
