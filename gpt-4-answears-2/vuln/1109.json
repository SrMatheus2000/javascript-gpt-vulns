"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Missing Signature Verification"],
"description": "The function jwt_decode has a parameter 'noVerify' which, if set to true, allows the function to return the payload without verifying the signature. This could allow an attacker to forge a token and bypass the signature verification process, leading to potential unauthorized access."
