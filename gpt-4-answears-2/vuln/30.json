"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Potential Denial of Service (DoS)"],
"description": "The function 'decodeMap' does not have any checks for the size of the input buffer. If a large buffer is passed, it could lead to excessive consumption of CPU resources, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. This is because the function iterates over the buffer without any limit, which could be exploited by an attacker to cause the application to consume excessive resources."
