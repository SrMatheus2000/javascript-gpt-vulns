"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks. If an attacker provides a large sourceMapString, the regular expression can cause the application to freeze, leading to Denial of Service. Additionally, the function does not validate the input, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the input does not match the expected format."
