"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) because it uses the 'decodeURIComponent' function on 'reqUrl' which is user-controlled input. This can allow an attacker to access arbitrary files on the system by sending special characters in 'reqUrl'. Additionally, the function may also be vulnerable to Incorrect Permission Assignment (CWE-706) as it does not seem to perform any authorization checks before accessing the file at 'staticPath'."
