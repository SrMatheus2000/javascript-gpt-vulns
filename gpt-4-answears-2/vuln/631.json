"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the use of 'innerHTML' property in the 'domProps' object. This property sets or returns the HTML content (inner HTML) of an element. If the HTML content contains a script, this script will be executed. An attacker can inject malicious scripts to be executed, leading to an XSS attack."
