"description": "The function does not properly validate the input 'form' which can lead to injection attacks if the input is controlled by an attacker. The function also does not control the consumption of resources which can lead to a denial of service if an attacker provides a large 'form'. The function also does not properly handle errors which can lead to unexpected behavior."
