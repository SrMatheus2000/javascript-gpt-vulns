"description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection, Cross-site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). SQL Injection can occur when the function uses user-supplied input without proper validation or escaping, allowing an attacker to manipulate SQL queries. XSS can occur when the function uses user-supplied input in the output HTML without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts. CSRF can occur when the function performs state-changing operations without proper anti-CSRF protections, allowing an attacker to trick a victim into performing actions without their consent."
