"isVulnerable": true,

"vulnerabilities": ["Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"],
"description": "The function unique_name_559 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input (stringId, subs) in the function without sanitizing or validating it. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through the 'stringId' or 'subs' parameters, which will then be executed in the user's browser."
