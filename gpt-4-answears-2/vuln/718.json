"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct a file path without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to access arbitrary files. It's also vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79) as it directly uses user input in the response without proper encoding or escaping, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts. Additionally, it exposes potentially sensitive information in error messages (CWE-209), which could provide useful information to an attacker."
