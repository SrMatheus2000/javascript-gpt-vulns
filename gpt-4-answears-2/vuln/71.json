"description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection because it concatenates a sanitized URL directly into a command string that is then executed. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands. The function also modifies the prototype of string objects, which can lead to prototype pollution if user-supplied input is passed to the function. Additionally, the function does not properly validate the input, which can lead to unexpected behavior. Finally, the function does not check if the string at index 'i' is null before calling toLowerCase on it, which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference."
