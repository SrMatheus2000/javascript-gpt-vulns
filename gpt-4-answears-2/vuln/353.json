"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'markup' parameter is directly used to generate HTML without proper sanitization or encoding, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts. The 'cssStrings' variable is also directly inserted into a style tag, which could lead to CSS Injection if the 'theme' or 'options' parameters are controlled by an attacker."
