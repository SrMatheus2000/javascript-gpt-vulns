"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-79"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function takes an input 'd' and uses it to create HTML tags without properly sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, which would then be executed in the context of the victim's session. The vulnerability is specifically related to the 'match' and 'extra.match' methods, which use regular expressions to parse the input but do not adequately sanitize it."
