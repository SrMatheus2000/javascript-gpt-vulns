"description": "The function has several vulnerabilities. First, it exposes sensitive information through error messages (CWE-209) when the SERVE_USER and SERVE_PASSWORD environment variables are not set. Second, it uses a wildcard '*' in the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header (CWE-598), which allows any domain to access the resources, leading to potential Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues. Third, it uses the 'fs.exists' function (CWE-200) which can lead to Information Exposure as it discloses whether a specific file exists or not."
