"description": "The function parseDCC does not validate the input 'source' which can lead to unexpected behavior (CWE-20). Also, the function uses the 'indexOf' method on the 'source' input which can lead to high CPU usage if the 'source' input is large, leading to a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack (CWE-400)."
