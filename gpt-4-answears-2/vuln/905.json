"description": "The function unique_name_474 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly concatenates user input (text.title and text.content) into HTML code without any form of sanitization or encoding. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through the 'title' or 'content' properties of the 'text' object, which would then be executed when the resulting HTML is rendered in a web browser."
