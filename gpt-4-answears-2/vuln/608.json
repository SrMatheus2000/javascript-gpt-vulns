"description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection as it uses user input to construct a command that is executed by a system shell. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. The function also exposes sensitive information by not properly handling the password. If the password is not provided, it is set to undefined which can lead to information exposure. Additionally, the function does not control the consumption of system resources which can lead to a denial of service attack."
