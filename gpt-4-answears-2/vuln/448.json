"description": "The function unique_name_214 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses the 'msg' parameter to create a jQuery object, which is then inserted into the DOM. If 'msg' contains malicious script, it will be executed when the jQuery object is created."
