"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) as it allows cross-origin requests (CORS) without proper validation or token checks. This could allow an attacker to trick a victim into making an unwanted request to the server. Additionally, the function does not properly validate the pathname input, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues."
