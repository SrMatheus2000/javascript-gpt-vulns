"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it takes an HTML string as input and directly injects it into the DOM without proper sanitization or escaping. An attacker could potentially provide a malicious string containing script tags, which would then be executed in the context of the user's browser."
