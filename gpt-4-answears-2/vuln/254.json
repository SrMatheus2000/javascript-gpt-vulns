"description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the 'options' input, which can lead to Information Disclosure (CWE-200) if sensitive information is passed. It also does not limit the size of the files that can be read, which can lead to a Potential Denial of Service (CWE-400) if a large file is requested. Additionally, the function does not validate the 'urlPath' input in the 'readFileFromContentBase' function, which can lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (CWE-918) if a malicious URL is passed."
