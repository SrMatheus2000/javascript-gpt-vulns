"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-78"],
"vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection"],
"description": "The function unique_name_380 is vulnerable to OS command injection because it concatenates a string that is passed to the exec function without any sanitization. An attacker could provide a malicious string as the 'iface' parameter, which could lead to arbitrary command execution."
