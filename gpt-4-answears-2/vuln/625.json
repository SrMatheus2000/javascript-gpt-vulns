"description": "The function is vulnerable to several issues. First, it does not properly validate input, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious data (CWE-20). Second, it exposes sensitive information in error messages (CWE-209), which could provide an attacker with valuable information about the system. Third, it does not limit the size of the data it processes (CWE-400), which could lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service. Finally, it does not properly protect sensitive data (CWE-200), potentially exposing it to unauthorized parties."
