"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-78"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Command Injection"],
"description": "The function diskusage is vulnerable to command injection because it concatenates a user-supplied path directly into a command that is executed by the system. An attacker could provide a path that includes command line syntax, which could result in arbitrary command execution."
