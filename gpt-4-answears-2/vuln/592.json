"description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection because it concatenates a variable (this.processName) directly into the API route. An attacker could potentially manipulate this.processName to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Additionally, the function does not properly validate the 'limit' parameter from the request query, which could lead to unexpected behavior."
