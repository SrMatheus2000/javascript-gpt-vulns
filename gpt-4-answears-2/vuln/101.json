"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-78", "CWE-22"],
"vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection", "Path Traversal"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection because it uses user-supplied input in a command that is executed by the system. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. The function is also vulnerable to path traversal attacks because it uses user-supplied input to construct file paths without properly sanitizing the input, which can allow an attacker to access arbitrary files on the system."
