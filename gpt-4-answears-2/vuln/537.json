"vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "Improper Input Validation"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) as it accepts and uses tokens from various sources (body, query, headers, cookies) without proper validation. This could allow an attacker to trick a victim into making an unintended request to the web application. The function also does not validate the input properly, which could lead to other potential vulnerabilities."
