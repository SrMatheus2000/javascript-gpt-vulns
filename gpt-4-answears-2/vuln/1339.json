"description": "The function is vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) because it does not limit the size of the input string. If a large string is passed, it could lead to high memory consumption and potentially crash the system. It is also vulnerable to Improper Input Validation (CWE-20) because it does not validate the input string before processing it. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the string is not in the expected format."
