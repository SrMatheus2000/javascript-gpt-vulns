"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it reads a file using a path that could potentially be manipulated. It's also vulnerable to Code Injection (CWE-94) as it directly uses the 'params' object without any validation or sanitization, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious code. Additionally, the function could be vulnerable to SQL Injection (CWE-89) as it uses parameters directly in SQL queries without any validation or sanitization."
