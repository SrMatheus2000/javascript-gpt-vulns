"description": "The provided JavaScript function does not appear to contain any obvious security vulnerabilities. It uses strict mode to prevent certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions. It also uses the replace method with hardcoded values, which reduces the risk of injection attacks. The function also does not seem to use any deprecated or risky JavaScript methods. However, a comprehensive security audit by a JavaScript expert could potentially reveal subtle vulnerabilities or areas for improvement."
