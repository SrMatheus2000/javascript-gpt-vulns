"description": "The function is vulnerable to several issues. First, it does not properly validate the input 'value' which can lead to various attacks such as SQL Injection, XSS, etc. Second, sensitive data like 'password' is not encrypted before being used which can expose it to attackers. Third, the function uses 'base64' encoding which is not a secure method of encryption. Fourth, the function does not use a salt while hashing the password which makes it vulnerable to Rainbow Table attacks. Lastly, the function does not use sufficient computational effort while hashing the password which makes it vulnerable to Brute Force attacks."
