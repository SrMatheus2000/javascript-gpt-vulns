"isVulnerable": true,

"vulnerabilities": ["Command Injection", "SQL Injection", "Improper Input Validation"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection because it uses user-supplied input in a command that is executed by the system. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. The function is also vulnerable to SQL injection because it uses user-supplied input in a SQL query without properly sanitizing it. This can allow an attacker to manipulate the SQL query and access or modify data in the database. The function also does not properly validate user-supplied input, which can lead to various types of attacks."
