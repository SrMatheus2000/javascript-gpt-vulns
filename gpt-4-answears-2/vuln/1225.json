"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user-supplied input (the 'data' parameter) to create HTML content. If an attacker can control the 'data' parameter, they can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code, which will be executed in the context of the victim's session. This can lead to session hijacking, identity theft, defacement of the website, and other attacks."
