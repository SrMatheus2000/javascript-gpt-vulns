"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'id' variable is directly concatenated into the 'optionTemplate' string without any form of sanitization or encoding. If an attacker can control the value of 'id', they can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the page, leading to a variety of attacks such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
