"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-200: Information Exposure", "CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Sensitive data exposure"],
"description": "The function 'createProject' is vulnerable as it exposes sensitive information. The encryption key 'credentialSecret' is being stored in the 'metadata' object which can be accessed by the 'user' object. This can lead to exposure of sensitive information if the 'user' object is compromised. Also, the function does not validate or sanitize the 'metadata' object which can lead to other potential vulnerabilities."
