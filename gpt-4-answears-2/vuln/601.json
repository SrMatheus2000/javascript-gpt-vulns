"vulnerabilities": ["Command Injection", "Insufficiently Protected Credentials"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection because it constructs a command using user-supplied input (params) which is then executed. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. Additionally, the function creates a password file with a blank cipher and the password in plaintext, which is insecure and could allow an attacker to easily obtain the password."
