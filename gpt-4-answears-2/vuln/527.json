"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it directly uses user input in the HTML output without proper sanitization or escaping. This is evident in the line `$(\".request_url\", $(this.el)).html(\"<pre>\" + this.invocationUrl + \"</pre>\");`. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through the `invocationUrl` variable. The function is also vulnerable to Improper Input Validation because it does not validate or sanitize the user input before processing it. This is evident in the lines where it directly uses the user input from the form to set the `headerParams` and `bodyParam` without any validation or sanitization."
