"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input in file paths without properly sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to access, read, or modify files outside of the intended directories. The function is also vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79) as it does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before including it in the generated output. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that would be executed by the victim's browser."
