"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it reads files directly from the filesystem without validating the input, which could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files. It is also vulnerable to SQL Injection (CWE-89) and OS Command Injection (CWE-78) as it constructs and executes database queries and system commands using user-supplied input, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries and system commands."
