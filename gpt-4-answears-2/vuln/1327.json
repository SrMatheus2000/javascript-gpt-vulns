"description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection because it uses childProcess.execFile() with user-supplied input (browserPath) without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to path traversal attacks because it uses path.resolve() with user-supplied input (browserPath) without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access arbitrary files on the system."
