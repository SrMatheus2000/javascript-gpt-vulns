"vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection"],
"description": "The function 'unique_name_131' is vulnerable to OS command injection. The 'command' parameter is concatenated directly into the command that is passed to 'shell.exec', which can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands. The 'command' parameter should be properly sanitized before use to prevent this vulnerability."
