"description": "The provided JavaScript function does not appear to have any obvious security vulnerabilities. It checks the type of its arguments, uses hasOwnProperty to avoid prototype pollution, and does not use any dangerous functions or methods. However, without knowing the implementation of the methods like _deeperArray, _sanitize, _back, and asyncItems, it's impossible to say for certain that there are no vulnerabilities."
