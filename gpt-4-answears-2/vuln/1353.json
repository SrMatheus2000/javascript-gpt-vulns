"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-78"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Command Injection"],
"description": "The function unique_name_788 is vulnerable to command injection because it concatenates a user-supplied command directly into a string that is executed as a shell command. An attacker could provide a malicious command that is executed with the privileges of the process, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data corruption, denial of service, or unauthorized access or privilege escalation."
