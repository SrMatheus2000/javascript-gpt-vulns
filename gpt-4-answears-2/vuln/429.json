"description": "The function unique_name_203 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses the 'text' parameter to set the innerHTML of the 'statusElem' element. An attacker could potentially provide malicious script as input which would then be executed in the context of the user's browser."
