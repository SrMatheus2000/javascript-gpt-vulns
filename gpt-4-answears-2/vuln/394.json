"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-79"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability exists because the function uses the 'getData' method to get the 'originalUrl' from an image and assigns it to the 'src' attribute of a new image element without proper sanitization or validation. If an attacker can control the 'originalUrl' of an image, they can inject malicious scripts that will be executed when the new image element is rendered in the browser."
