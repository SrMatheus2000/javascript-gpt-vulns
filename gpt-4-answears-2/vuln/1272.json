"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-78"],
"vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection"],
"description": "The function unique_name_744 is vulnerable to OS command injection because it concatenates a user-supplied variable (direction) directly into a command that is executed without proper sanitization. An attacker could provide a malicious input to the 'direction' parameter to execute arbitrary commands on the system."
