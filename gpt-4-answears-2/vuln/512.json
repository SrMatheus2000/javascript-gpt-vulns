"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability exists because the function uses string interpolation to create HTML content, which is then inserted into the page. If the 'props.suggestionText' or 'value[props.displayKey]' variables contain malicious scripts, they will be executed when the HTML content is inserted into the page."
