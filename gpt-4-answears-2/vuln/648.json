"description": "The function uses the crypto.randomBytes method to generate a random number, but it only uses the first byte of the result. This means that the entropy of the generated number is limited to 256 possible values, which may not be sufficient for all use cases. Additionally, the use of the modulo operator can introduce bias into the generated numbers, as the distribution of values may not be uniform."
