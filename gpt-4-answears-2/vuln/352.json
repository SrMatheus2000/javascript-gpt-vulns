"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-79"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function processes image tags and directly injects the result into the HTML without proper sanitization or encoding. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, which would then be executed in the context of the victim's browser. The vulnerability is specifically in the 'html' variable where the 'styleHtml' and 'html' are concatenated and returned without any sanitization."
