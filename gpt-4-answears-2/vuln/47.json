"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct file paths without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access, read, or modify files outside of the intended directory. It also exposes detailed error messages (CWE-209) which could provide an attacker with valuable information about the system. Additionally, the function does not limit the amount of resources it can use (CWE-400), potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack."
