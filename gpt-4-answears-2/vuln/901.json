"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to access files without proper validation. It's also vulnerable to Code Injection (CWE-94) as it uses user input in the 'options.filter' without proper sanitization. Lastly, it's vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) as it does not limit the amount of resources it can use when reading files, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack."
