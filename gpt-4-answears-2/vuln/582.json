"vulnerabilities": ["Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data", "NULL Pointer Dereference"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID) as it modifies the target object which might be assumed to be immutable by other parts of the program. This can lead to unexpected behavior. Also, the function does not check if the 'options' object is null before accessing its properties, which can lead to a NULL Pointer Dereference."
