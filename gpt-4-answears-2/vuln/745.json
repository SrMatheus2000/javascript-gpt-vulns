"vulnerabilities": ["Type confusion", "Potential null or undefined reference"],
"description": "The function does not validate if the input 'array' is actually an array, which can lead to type confusion. Also, the function 'getEnumerableOwnPropertyKeys' and 'clone' are not defined within the scope of this function, which can lead to null or undefined reference if they are not defined elsewhere in the code."
