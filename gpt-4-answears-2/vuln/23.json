"vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection"],
"description": "The function uses the 'new Function()' constructor to create a new function from a string of JavaScript code. This is dangerous as it allows for arbitrary code execution. If an attacker can control the 'settings.variable' or 'text' inputs, they could inject malicious code into the function, leading to a variety of attacks such as data theft, data corruption, or server takeover."
