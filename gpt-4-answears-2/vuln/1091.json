"description": "The function downloads a file from a URL that is constructed using unvalidated input, which can allow an attacker to download arbitrary files. This is a form of CWE-829. The function also does not handle errors properly, which can lead to uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400). Additionally, the function uses the 'eval' function, which can lead to code injection (CWE-94) if the input is not properly sanitized."
