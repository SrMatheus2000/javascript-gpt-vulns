"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input in file paths without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to access or manipulate files outside of the intended directory. It is also vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79) as it does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before returning it in the HTTP response, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CWE-352) as it does not implement any CSRF protection mechanism, allowing an attacker to trick a victim into making an unintended request. Lastly, the function is vulnerable to Information Exposure (CWE-200) as it reveals sensitive information in error messages."
