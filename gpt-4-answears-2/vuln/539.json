"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-78", "CWE-20"],
"vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection", "Improper Input Validation"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection because it uses user-supplied input in a command that is executed by the operating system. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. The function also does not validate the input from the user, which can lead to other types of attacks."
