"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function uses the 'PMA_commonParams.get('table')' method to get the table name, which is then concatenated into a string that is used in the 'PMA_confirm' function. If an attacker can control the value of 'table', they could inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the context of the user's session."
