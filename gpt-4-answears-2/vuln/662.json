"description": "The function compile is vulnerable to code injection. It dynamically generates code using the 'new Function' constructor, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if user-supplied input is not properly sanitized. The 'format' parameter is directly used in the generation of the 'js' variable, which is then passed to the 'new Function' constructor. If an attacker can control the 'format' parameter, they can inject arbitrary code into the generated function."
