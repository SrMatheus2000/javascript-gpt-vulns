"description": "The function is vulnerable to URL redirection attacks because it does not validate the URL before passing it to the renderer.serialize function. This could allow an attacker to redirect users to an untrusted site. Additionally, the function exposes potentially sensitive information through error messages, which could be exploited to gain more information about the system or application."
