"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) because it directly injects user input into HTML without proper sanitization or escaping. An attacker could exploit this by providing malicious script as 'suggestionText' or 'displayKey' in 'props' or 'value' in 'value'. This script would then be executed when the HTML is rendered."
