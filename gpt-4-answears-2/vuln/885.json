"description": "The function uses SHA-1, which is a weak hashing function and can be vulnerable to collision attacks. It also uses password hash with insufficient computational effort, making it easier for attackers to guess the password. Lastly, it uses password hash instead of a Password-Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF), which is a more secure way of storing passwords."
