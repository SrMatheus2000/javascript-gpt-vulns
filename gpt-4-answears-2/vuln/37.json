"vulnerabilities": ["Null Pointer Dereference", "Improper Input Validation"],
"description": "The function 'unique_name_14' is vulnerable to Null Pointer Dereference and Improper Input Validation. The variable 'obj' is not defined within the function, which could lead to a Null Pointer Dereference if it is not properly initialized before the function is called. Additionally, the function does not validate the input 'ch', which could lead to unexpected behavior if 'ch' is not an object with the expected properties."
