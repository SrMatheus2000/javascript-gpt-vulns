"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function uses the jQuery html() method to set the innerHTML of an element. This method does not escape or sanitize the input, which means that if the input contains script tags, the script will be executed when the HTML is rendered. This can lead to various security issues, such as stealing user data or performing actions on behalf of the user."
