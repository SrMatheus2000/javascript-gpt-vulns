"isVulnerable": true,

"vulnerabilities": ["Memory Leak"],
"description": "The function creates a new cache object without any limit on the size. This can lead to a memory leak if the cache grows indefinitely. This is especially problematic if the function is called repeatedly with different arguments, as a new cache entry is created for each unique argument."
