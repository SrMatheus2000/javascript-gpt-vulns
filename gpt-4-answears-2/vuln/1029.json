"isVulnerable": true,

"vulnerabilities": ["SQL Injection", "Input Validation", "Information Exposure"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection as it directly uses user-provided data (socketIOData) in the req.params without any sanitization or parameterized queries. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the SQL query. It also lacks proper input validation (CWE-20) as it does not validate or sanitize the socketIOData before using it. This could lead to various attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Command Injection, etc. The function also exposes sensitive information (CWE-200) as it logs error messages which might contain sensitive information."
