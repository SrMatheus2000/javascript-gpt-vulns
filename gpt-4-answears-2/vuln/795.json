"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to access files (req.url). An attacker could manipulate the path to access sensitive files outside of the intended directory. It's also vulnerable to Information Exposure (CWE-200) as it reveals system-level details when an error occurs, which could provide useful information to an attacker."
