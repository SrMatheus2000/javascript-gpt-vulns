"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct a file path without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to access arbitrary files. It also exposes sensitive information through error messages (CWE-209) by logging and sending the error object directly to the client. Additionally, the function can lead to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) as it synchronously reads file stats for each file in a directory, which can block the event loop if the directory contains a large number of files."
