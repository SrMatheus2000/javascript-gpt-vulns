"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function uses the jQuery $.trim() and $.text() methods to handle user input, which can lead to XSS attacks if the input is not properly sanitized. This is because these methods do not escape HTML and JavaScript code, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts."
