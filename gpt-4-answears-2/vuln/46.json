"description": "The function unique_name_20 has several potential vulnerabilities. First, it may disclose sensitive information through error messages (CWE-209). Second, it does not limit the consumption of system resources, which could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack (CWE-400). Lastly, it does not properly limit the pathname to a restricted directory, which could allow an attacker to access files outside of the intended directories (CWE-22)."
