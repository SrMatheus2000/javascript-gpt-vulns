"description": "The function escapeshellarg is intended to escape any special characters in a string that is used as a shell argument. However, the current implementation only escapes single quotes that are not preceded by a backslash. This leaves the function vulnerable to injection attacks if the input string contains any other special characters that are not properly escaped."
