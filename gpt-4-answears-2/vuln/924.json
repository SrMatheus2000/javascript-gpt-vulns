"description": "The function unique_name_488 is vulnerable to code injection. It uses the new Function() constructor to create a new function from a string. This is dangerous as it allows for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the 'template' parameter, which would then be executed."
