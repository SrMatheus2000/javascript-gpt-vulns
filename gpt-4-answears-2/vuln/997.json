"description": "The function convertToSVG is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it takes an input string (_str) and directly uses it to create SVG elements without properly sanitizing it. An attacker could inject malicious scripts through _str, which would then be executed when the SVG is rendered."
