"vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection", "Argument Injection", "Path Traversal"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection because it constructs a shell command using string concatenation with unsanitized input. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. The function is also vulnerable to argument injection because it constructs a git command using string concatenation with unsanitized input. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the git command to perform unintended actions. Lastly, the function is vulnerable to path traversal because it uses unsanitized input to construct a file path. This could allow an attacker to access arbitrary files on the system."
