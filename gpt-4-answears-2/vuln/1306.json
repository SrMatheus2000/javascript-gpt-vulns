"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-78", "CWE-20", "CWE-200"],
"vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection", "Improper Input Validation", "Information Exposure"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection because it uses user-supplied input in exec() function calls without proper sanitization or validation. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. Additionally, the function does not validate the input for the 'key' parameter in the 'set' method of 'envVars' and 'wfVars', which could lead to unexpected behavior. The function also exposes potentially sensitive information through error messages."
