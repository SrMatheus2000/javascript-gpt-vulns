"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-78", "CWE-22"],
"vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection", "Path Traversal"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection because it concatenates user-controlled input into a command that is executed by the system. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. The function is also vulnerable to path traversal because it uses user-controlled input to construct a file path without properly sanitizing the input, which could allow an attacker to access arbitrary files on the system."
