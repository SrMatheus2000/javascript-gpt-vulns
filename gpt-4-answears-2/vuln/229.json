"description": "The function createMenuItems is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input to create HTML elements without properly sanitizing the input. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through the 'item.text' and 'item.title' variables, which are directly used to create HTML content. This could lead to various security issues, such as stealing sensitive data, performing actions on behalf of the user, or spreading malware."
