"description": "The function seems to be vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. It appears to be sanitizing and processing HTML input, but it's not clear if it's doing so safely for all cases. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users."
