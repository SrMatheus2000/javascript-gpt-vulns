{
"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-22"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Path Traversal"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal attack (also known as Directory Traversal). The vulnerability exists because the function uses user-supplied input in 'req.params['*']' without proper validation or sanitization to read a file. An attacker can manipulate the 'file' parameter to read arbitrary files from the system which could lead to disclosure of sensitive information."
