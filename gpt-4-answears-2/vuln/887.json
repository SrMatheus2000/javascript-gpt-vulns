"vulnerabilities": ["Insecure Randomness", "Potential Information Exposure"],
"description": "The function uses Math.random() for generating random values which is not cryptographically secure. This can lead to predictable values being generated, leading to potential attacks. Also, the function may expose sensitive information through the hashing of the password and message, which could potentially be exploited."
