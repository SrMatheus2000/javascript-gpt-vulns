"vulnerabilities": ["Command Injection", "SQL Injection"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection because it concatenates a user-supplied string (name) directly into a command that is executed by the system. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to SQL injection because it uses user-supplied input (name) in a SQL query without properly sanitizing it. This allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query and potentially access, modify, or delete data in the database."
