"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-327", "CWE-918"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"],
"description": "The function uses a cryptographic algorithm that is potentially broken or risky (alg === 'none'). This could allow an attacker to break the encryption and gain access to sensitive information. Additionally, the function does not validate or sanitize the input (sJWS, key), which could lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if the input includes a malicious URL."
