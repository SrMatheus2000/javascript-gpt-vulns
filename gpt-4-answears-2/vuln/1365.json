"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it does not validate or sanitize the 'version' parameter, which is used to construct a URL. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the path to access or overwrite arbitrary files. It is also vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (CWE-94) as it downloads and executes a file from an external source without any validation. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Additionally, it is vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) as it does not limit the size of the file being downloaded, which could lead to a denial of service."
