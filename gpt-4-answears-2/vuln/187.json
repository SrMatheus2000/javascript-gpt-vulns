"description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the 'params' input, which could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the input is controlled by an attacker. Additionally, the function uses the 'params' input directly in the creation of a new Vue instance, which could lead to other potential vulnerabilities if the input is not properly controlled."
