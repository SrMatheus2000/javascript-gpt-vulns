"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319) because it uses 'rejectUnauthorized: false' which allows unauthorized certificates. This can lead to Man-in-the-Middle attacks. The function is also vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) because it does not limit the amount of data that can be appended to the 'buffer' object. This can lead to a Denial of Service attack by consuming all available memory."
