"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Use of Deprecated or Unsafe Function"],
"description": "The function uses the 'new Buffer()' constructor, which is deprecated and unsafe due to vulnerabilities that can lead to security issues like memory exposure if not used properly. It's recommended to use 'Buffer.from()', 'Buffer.alloc()', or 'Buffer.allocUnsafe()' instead."
