"description": "The function uses the 'new Buffer()' constructor, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if the input is not properly validated. This can allow an attacker to overwrite data and execute arbitrary code. It's recommended to use 'Buffer.from()', 'Buffer.alloc()', or 'Buffer.allocUnsafe()' instead."
