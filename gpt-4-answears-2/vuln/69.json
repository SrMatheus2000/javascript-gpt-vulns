"description": "The function uses the Function constructor to create a new function from a string of JavaScript code. This is dangerous as it allows for arbitrary code execution. If an attacker can control the input to the Function constructor, they can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, leading to a variety of attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), data theft, or denial of service."
