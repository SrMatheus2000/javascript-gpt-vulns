"description": "The function 'unique_name_344' is vulnerable to command injection. The 'cmd' variable is constructed by concatenating user-supplied input ('opts' and 'range'), which is then passed to the 'proc' function and executed. An attacker could provide malicious input to execute arbitrary commands on the system. This is a serious security issue that could lead to full system compromise. The function does not perform any input validation or sanitization, making it susceptible to command injection attacks."
