"description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the 'repo' input, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious code. This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as SQL Injection if the 'repo' input is used in a SQL query, or Cross-site Scripting if the 'repo' input is rendered on a web page. Additionally, the function does not use 'var', 'let', or 'const' to declare 'repoUrl', making it a global variable, which could lead to unexpected behavior if another part of the code uses a variable with the same name."
