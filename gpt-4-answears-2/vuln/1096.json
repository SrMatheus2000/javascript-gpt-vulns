"vulnerabilities": ["Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "Improper Input Validation"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) because it sends a request to a URL that is constructed by concatenating a static string with user-controlled input (parsedMinor.minorVersion). An attacker could potentially control the destination of the request by providing a malicious value for minorVersion. Additionally, the function does not properly validate the input before using it, which could lead to other types of attacks."
