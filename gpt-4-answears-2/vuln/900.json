"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input in file paths without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to access arbitrary files. It is also vulnerable to Information Exposure (CWE-200) as it reveals system-level details such as file paths and system status, which could be used by an attacker to gain more information about the system."
