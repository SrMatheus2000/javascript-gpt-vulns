"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input in file paths without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server. It is also vulnerable to Information Exposure (CWE-200) as it reveals sensitive information about the internal workings of the application, such as file paths and server configuration, which could be used by an attacker to exploit other vulnerabilities."
