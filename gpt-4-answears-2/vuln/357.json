"description": "The provided JavaScript function does not appear to have any obvious vulnerabilities. It properly checks the type of the 'range' parameter and ensures that 'range.from' and 'range.to' are positive integers. It also checks that 'range.to' is greater than or equal to 'range.from'. The function also properly handles events for adding and removing pipes. Therefore, no Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) are identified."
