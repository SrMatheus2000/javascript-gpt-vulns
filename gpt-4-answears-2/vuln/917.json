"description": "The function _showHeader is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input (repo.username, repo.reponame, repo.branch) in the HTML content without proper sanitization or encoding. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through these inputs, which will be executed when the HTML content is rendered in the browser."
