"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-78", "CWE-20"],
"vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection", "Input Validation"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection because it concatenates a user-supplied input (options.file) directly into a command that is executed by the system. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. Additionally, the function does not validate or sanitize the input, which could lead to other types of attacks."
