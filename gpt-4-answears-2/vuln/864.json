"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to code injection. This is because it uses the Function constructor in the 'FunctionExpression' block. The Function constructor is a form of eval() that executes code. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if a user is able to influence the values of 'keys' and 'unparse(node)' which are directly included in the generation of new code. This is a serious security risk as it allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code, leading to various attacks such as data theft, data corruption, and server takeover."
