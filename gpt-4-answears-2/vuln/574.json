"description": "The function is vulnerable to path traversal attacks. It uses user-supplied input to construct a file path for file-system operations without properly neutralizing special elements that could resolve to a location that was not intended by the developer. This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or test the existence of arbitrary files and directories."
