"description": "The function is vulnerable to path traversal attacks (CWE-22) because it uses user-supplied input to construct a file path without properly validating or sanitizing the input. This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete files outside of the intended directory. The function is also vulnerable to external control of file name or path (CWE-73) because it uses user-supplied input in the 'downloadUrl' variable to determine the name and location of a file to download. This could allow an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files. The function is vulnerable to code injection (CWE-94) because it uses the 'spawn' function to execute a command without properly sanitizing the 'downloadedFile' variable, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. Finally, the function is vulnerable to resource injection (CWE-99) because it uses user-supplied input in the 'downloadUrl' variable to determine the URL of a resource to download, which could allow an attacker to cause the function to download malicious resources."
