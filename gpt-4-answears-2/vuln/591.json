"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-89", "CWE-20"],
"vulnerabilities": ["SQL Injection", "Improper Input Validation"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection because it concatenates a variable (this.processName) directly into the API route without any sanitization or parameterization. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the API route and potentially execute arbitrary code. Additionally, the function does not properly validate the 'limit' query parameter before using it to slice an array, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors."
