"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function uses template literals to inject values directly into HTML without proper sanitization or encoding. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts by manipulating 'out' object properties, which would then be executed in the context of the user's browser."
