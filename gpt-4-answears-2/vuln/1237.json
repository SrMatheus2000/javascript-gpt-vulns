"description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the 'name' and 'config' inputs. This could lead to various types of attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, and Command Injection if the inputs contain malicious strings. The 'name' input is directly used in URL resolution which could lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if it contains a malicious URL. The 'config' input is used to get registry and credentials which could lead to exposure of sensitive information if it contains malicious keys."
