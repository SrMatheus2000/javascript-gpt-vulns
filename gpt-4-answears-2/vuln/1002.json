"description": "The function uses the 'rsa-sha256' algorithm by default if no algorithm is provided. This algorithm is considered weak and can be vulnerable to attacks. Also, the function does not validate the 'options.key' input which can lead to security vulnerabilities if the key is not properly validated before being used in the cryptographic operations."
