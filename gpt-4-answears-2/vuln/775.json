"vulnerabilities": ["Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)", "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"],
"description": "The function uses regular expressions (regex) which can lead to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) if the regex process takes a long time to complete. This can happen if the input string is very long or crafted in a way that causes the regex to take a long time to evaluate. Additionally, the function does not validate the input 'index' and 'diffstr[i]' which can lead to uncontrolled resource consumption if they are not properly controlled."
