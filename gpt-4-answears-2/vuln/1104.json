"description": "The function does not encrypt sensitive data, which can expose it to attackers. The initialization vector (IV) for the encryption may not be sufficiently random, which can make the encryption easier to break. The function also has a session fixation vulnerability, where a user's session ID is not properly managed, allowing an attacker to hijack the user's session."
