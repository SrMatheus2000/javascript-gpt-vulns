"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-78"],
"vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection"],
"description": "The function unique_name_141 is vulnerable to OS command injection because it concatenates a user-supplied input (gitUrl, options) directly into a command that is executed without proper sanitization or validation. An attacker could provide a malicious input to execute arbitrary commands on the system."
