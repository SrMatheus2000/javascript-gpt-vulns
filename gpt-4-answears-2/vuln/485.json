"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input to construct file paths without proper validation or sanitization, potentially allowing an attacker to access or modify arbitrary files. It is also vulnerable to SQL Injection (CWE-89) as it uses user-supplied input in SQL queries without proper sanitization, potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate the queries. The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (CWE-79) as it reflects user-supplied input without proper sanitization, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts. Lastly, it is vulnerable to Information Exposure (CWE-200) as it may reveal sensitive information in error messages."
