"description": "The function is vulnerable to code injection via the 'ruleSource' parameter. If an attacker can control the value of 'ruleSource', they can potentially execute arbitrary code. The function also does not properly validate the input, which can lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function does not control the consumption of resources, which can lead to a denial of service if an attacker provides a large amount of data."
