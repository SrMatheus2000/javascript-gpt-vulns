"CWEs": ["CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Potential Denial of Service (DoS)"],
"description": "The function 'consume' can potentially lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. This is because it uses a while loop to process elements in the '_bufs' array without checking if the array is empty or not. If an attacker provides a large array, it could consume significant system resources, leading to a DoS condition."
