"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-79"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The data object is directly used in the function without any form of sanitization or encoding. If an attacker can control the content of the 'data' object, they can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of the victim's session. This can lead to session hijacking, identity theft, defacement of the website, and other attacks. The vulnerability is specifically in the lines where the 'data.error' and 'data.explain' are directly inserted into the HTML content."
