"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) because it directly uses user input in jQuery's .html() method without sanitizing or escaping it. An attacker could inject malicious scripts through the 'data' parameter, which would then be executed in the user's browser when the page is rendered."
