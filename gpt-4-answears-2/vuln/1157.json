"description": "The function is vulnerable to several types of attacks. It does not properly validate user input (CWE-20), which can lead to SQL Injection (CWE-89) if the input is used in a SQL query. It is also vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (CWE-79) if the input is used in a web page without proper sanitization. The function does not implement any CSRF protections (CWE-352), making it vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. Finally, the function exposes sensitive information (CWE-200) by including detailed error messages in the responses."
