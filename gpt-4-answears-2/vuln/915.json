"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Input Validation Error"],
"description": "The function does not validate the input for 'addr' and 'mask'. If the input is not a valid IP address or mask, the function 'ip.toBuffer()' could throw an error or behave unexpectedly. This could lead to potential Denial of Service (DoS) attacks if the function is exposed to external inputs. It is recommended to validate and sanitize the input before processing."
