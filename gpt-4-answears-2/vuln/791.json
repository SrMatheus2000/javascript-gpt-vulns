"description": "The provided JavaScript function does not appear to have any obvious security vulnerabilities. It is primarily setting up properties for a class, including regular expressions and default values. There is no direct manipulation of the DOM, no use of eval or Function constructors, and no obvious injection points where an attacker could provide malicious input. However, without the context of the rest of the application, it's impossible to say definitively whether there are no vulnerabilities."
