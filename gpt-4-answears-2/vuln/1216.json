"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function uses user input directly in the creation of HTML content (in the 'fields' variable). Although it attempts to escape HTML entities, it does not properly handle all cases, leaving potential for an attacker to inject malicious scripts. This is a violation of CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')."
