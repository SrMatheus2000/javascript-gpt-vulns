{
"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-89", "CWE-20"],
"vulnerabilities": ["SQL Injection", "Improper Input Validation"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection because it concatenates user-controlled input directly into a SQL query. This allows an attacker to manipulate the query and execute arbitrary SQL commands. Additionally, the function does not properly validate the input before using it, which can lead to various types of attacks."
