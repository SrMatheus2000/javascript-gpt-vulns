"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) because it uses user input to access files (via 'request.url') without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server. It's also vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79) because it directly uses user input in the response headers (via 'options.headers') without proper encoding or escaping. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts."
