"vulnerabilities": ["HTTP Header Injection", "HTTP Response Splitting"],
"description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the 'header' input from the 'req.headers' object. This could lead to HTTP Header Injection or HTTP Response Splitting attacks if an attacker can control the 'header' value. An attacker could inject malicious headers or perform HTTP response splitting which could lead to various attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS), session fixation, cross-user defacement, cache poisoning, etc."
