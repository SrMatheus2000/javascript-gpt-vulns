"vulnerabilities": ["Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "Improper Input Validation"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it takes a URL from the response headers and makes a request to it without any validation. This could allow an attacker to make the server send requests to arbitrary URLs, potentially leading to information disclosure or other impacts. Additionally, there is no proper input validation performed on the response data before it is used, which could lead to other types of attacks."
