{
"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Type Confusion"],
"description": "The function does not properly validate the types of input that it receives. This could lead to type confusion vulnerabilities where an attacker could potentially manipulate the function's behavior by providing unexpected input types. For example, if an attacker provides an object when the function expects an array, it could lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the input is not an object, which could lead to potential errors or vulnerabilities."
