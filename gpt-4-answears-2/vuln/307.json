"description": "The function uses the eval() function to dynamically generate code. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the input to the eval() function. In this case, the input to eval() is derived from the toString() method of the __parent member of the members object. If an attacker can control the __parent member, they can inject arbitrary code into the application."
