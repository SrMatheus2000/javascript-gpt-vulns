"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-78", "CWE-88", "CWE-20"],
"vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection", "Argument Injection", "Improper Input Validation"],
"description": "The function sync is vulnerable to OS command injection because it directly uses the input 'os' to form a command that is executed synchronously. An attacker could provide malicious input to execute arbitrary commands on the system. Additionally, there is no input validation to ensure that 'os' is of the expected format or within the expected range, leading to potential argument injection vulnerabilities."
