"description": "The function downloads and compiles a binary without verifying its integrity, which could lead to the execution of malicious code if the download is tampered with. Additionally, the function uses string interpolation to construct a command line string, which could lead to command injection if the bin.dest() function returns a string containing shell metacharacters."
