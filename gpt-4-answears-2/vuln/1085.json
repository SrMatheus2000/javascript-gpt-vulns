"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) because it uses user-supplied input in file paths without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to read or write files outside of the intended directories. It is also vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CWE-918) as it sends a request to a URL provided by the user without any validation, potentially allowing an attacker to interact with internal services. Lastly, the function does not properly validate or sanitize the user-supplied input (CWE-20), which can lead to various types of attacks."
