"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Hard-coded credentials", "Improper input validation"],
"description": "The function uses a hard-coded token to authenticate with Github, which is a security risk. If the token is compromised, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the Github account. Additionally, the function does not validate the input parameters 'repo.username', 'repo.reponame', and 'repo.branch'. This could lead to potential security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks."
