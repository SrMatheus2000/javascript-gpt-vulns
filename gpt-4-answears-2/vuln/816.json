"description": "The provided JavaScript function does not appear to contain any common security vulnerabilities. It is primarily composed of type checking and utility functions, and does not perform any risky operations such as eval(), does not manipulate the DOM directly, and does not handle sensitive data. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to common web security issues such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), or SQL Injection."
