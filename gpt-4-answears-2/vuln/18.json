"vulnerabilities": ["Prototype Pollution"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution which allows an attacker to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. This can lead to several types of vulnerabilities like Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, or even Cross-Site Scripting. This happens because the function does not validate the input and directly assigns properties to the object prototype."
