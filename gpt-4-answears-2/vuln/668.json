"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Command Injection"],
"description": "The function 'funcs' is vulnerable to command injection. The 'cmd' variable is constructed by concatenating user-controlled input ('opts' and 'range') without proper sanitization or validation. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands to be executed on the server side."
