"isVulnerable": true,

"description": "The function does not properly validate the type of 'opts' before using it as an object. This can lead to a type confusion vulnerability where an attacker can pass unexpected types leading to unexpected behavior. The function assumes 'opts' is an object and directly assigns properties to it, but there is no guarantee 'opts' is an object. This can lead to runtime errors if 'opts' is not an object. The function should check the type of 'opts' before using it."
