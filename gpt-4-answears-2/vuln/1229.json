"vulnerabilities": ["SQL Injection", "Denial of Service"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection because it concatenates the 'padId' directly into the SQL query without any sanitization or parameterization. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the SQL query and access, modify or delete data in the database. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks because it uses 'async.forEachSeries' to iterate over potentially large data sets, which could consume a lot of resources and slow down or crash the server if the data set is very large."
