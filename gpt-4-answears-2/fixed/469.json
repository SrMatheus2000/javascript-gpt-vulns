"description": "The function appears to be secure. It checks for a CSRF token in the request body, query, and headers. If none is found, it returns an empty string. The function does not check the cookie for the CSRF token, which is a correct implementation as per the comment in the code. This is because the CSRF token should not be accessible by JavaScript on the client side, preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks."
