"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to access files (filename) without properly validating or sanitizing the input. This could allow an attacker to access sensitive files outside of the intended directory. The function is also vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) as it reads files synchronously which could lead to denial of service if a large file is requested."
