"description": "The function 'unique_name_664' is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function does not properly sanitize the 'value' parameter when the 'name' parameter is not 'user_host'. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the context of the user's browser. The function should always sanitize input, regardless of the value of the 'name' parameter."
