"description": "The function checkCertificate is vulnerable to command injection. This is because it uses user-supplied input (the 'certificate' parameter) in a command that is executed by the openssl.spawnWrapper function. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by providing a specially crafted 'certificate' parameter."
