"description": "The function embedYoutubeIframe is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input (id and youtubeParams) in the creation of an iframe without properly sanitizing it. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through these parameters, which would then be executed when the iframe is loaded."
