"description": "The function logs sensitive information which can lead to information exposure through logs (CWE-117). It also does not validate the input received in req.params.func and req.params.version which can lead to various attacks (CWE-20). The function also seems to be vulnerable to JSONP callback function injection, as it directly uses the user-provided input to form a function call without proper sanitization (CWE-94)."
