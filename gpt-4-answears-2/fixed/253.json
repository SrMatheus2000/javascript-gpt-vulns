"description": "The function embedVimeoIframe is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input (id and vimeoParams) in the creation of an iframe without properly sanitizing or encoding the input. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through these parameters, which would then be executed in the context of the user's browser when the iframe is loaded."
