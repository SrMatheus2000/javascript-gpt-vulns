"description": "The function is vulnerable to both Code Injection and Path Traversal attacks. The 'name' parameter is directly concatenated to the string './', which is then passed to the 'require' function. This allows an attacker to potentially load and execute arbitrary code or access files outside of the intended directory. The function does not validate or sanitize the 'name' parameter, which makes it possible for an attacker to manipulate it."
