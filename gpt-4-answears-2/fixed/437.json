It also does not sanitize the 'name' input before using it in the generation of a web page, which can lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function also fails to properly validate the 'name' input before using it in the 'GetBrackets' and 'GetArgument' functions, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors."
