"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input in file paths without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete files outside of the intended directory. It's also vulnerable to Command Injection (CWE-78) and Code Injection (CWE-94) as it uses user-supplied input in command line arguments and code execution without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands or code on the server."
