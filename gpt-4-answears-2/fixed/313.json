"description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection. It uses user input to construct a command that is executed by the system. If an attacker can control the 'path' or 'opts' variables, they can inject arbitrary commands to be executed by the system. Additionally, the function attempts to sanitize the 'path' input by checking for suspicious characters, but this is not a comprehensive solution and can be bypassed by an attacker."
