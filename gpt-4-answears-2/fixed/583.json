"vulnerabilities": ["Prototype Pollution"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution which is a type of attack that occurs when an attacker is able to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. This can lead to a variety of application-level vulnerabilities including Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, or even Cross-Site Scripting. In this function, the vulnerability arises from the fact that it does not properly validate the input 'i' and allows modification of the prototype of 'o'."
