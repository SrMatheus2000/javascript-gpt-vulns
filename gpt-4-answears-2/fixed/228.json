"description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection because it uses child_process.execFileSync() with user-supplied input (learnFile, modelFile) without proper sanitization or validation. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. Additionally, the function exposes potentially sensitive information through error messages (console.log(fs.readFileSync(learnFile, 'utf-8'))), which could be exploited to gain further information about the system. Finally, the function does not properly handle resource shutdown or release, as it calls process.exit(0) in the middle of execution, which could lead to resource leaks or other unexpected behavior."
