"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input to update the DOM without proper sanitization or validation. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through the 'data' parameter, which will then be executed in the user's browser when the page is rendered."
