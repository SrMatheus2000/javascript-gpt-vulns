"description": "The function unique_name_494 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) because it directly uses the 'caption' variable to set the innerHTML of 'containerPlain'. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through the 'data-caption' attribute of the '$image' object, which will be executed when the HTML is rendered."
