"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-78", "CWE-88", "CWE-209"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Command Injection", "Argument Injection", "Information Exposure Through an Error Message"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to command and argument injection attacks because it constructs a command using user-supplied input (opts, range) without proper sanitization or validation. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. Additionally, the function discards stderr messages, which could contain important error information, potentially leading to information exposure."
