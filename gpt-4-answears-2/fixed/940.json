"description": "The function unique_name_534 is vulnerable to SQL Injection. The function constructs an SQL query by concatenating a user-controlled variable 'f.Field' directly into the query. An attacker could exploit this by injecting malicious SQL commands into 'f.Field', which would then be executed by the database."
