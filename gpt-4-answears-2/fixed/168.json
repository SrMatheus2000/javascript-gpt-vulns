"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'slot' variable is directly inserted into the template of 'CustomSlot' without any sanitization or escaping. This means that if 'slot' contains any malicious scripts, they will be executed when the component is rendered."
