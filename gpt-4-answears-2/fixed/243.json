"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-129", "CWE-20"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Improper Input Validation", "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"],
"description": "The function 'maybeoperatorNoComma' is vulnerable as it does not validate or sanitize the input parameters 'type', 'value', and 'noComma'. This could lead to issues such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) where malicious scripts are injected into web pages viewed by other users, or Improper Input Validation where the function behaves unexpectedly due to unanticipated input. The function also uses the '==' operator for comparison which can lead to unexpected type coercion issues. It is recommended to use the '===' operator for strict equality comparison."
