"description": "The function is vulnerable to a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack. If an attacker provides a deeply nested object, it could cause a stack overflow due to the recursive nature of the function. This is because JavaScript has a maximum call stack size and when it's exceeded, it will throw a RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded, effectively causing a Denial of Service."
