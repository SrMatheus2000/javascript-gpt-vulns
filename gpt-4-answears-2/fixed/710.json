"description": "The function uses regular expressions which can be exploited to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. An attacker can provide a specially crafted payload that causes the regular expression to take a long time to process, effectively blocking the event loop and causing a DoS condition. This is known as a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability. Additionally, the function uses recursion without any limit, which can lead to a stack overflow error if the recursion is too deep, causing the application to crash. This is known as an Uncontrolled Recursion vulnerability."
