"description": "The function sets the maximum number of listeners to 1000, which could potentially lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if an attacker is able to continuously open connections. This is because Node.js will throw a warning when more than 10 listeners are added for a particular event and this could potentially block the event loop."
