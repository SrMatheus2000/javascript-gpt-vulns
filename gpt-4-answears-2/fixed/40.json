"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to access file system paths without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access sensitive files or data outside of the intended directories. It also exposes potentially sensitive information through error messages (CWE-209), which could aid an attacker in further exploits. Additionally, the function does not properly control the allocation of resources, leading to potential resource exhaustion (CWE-400)."
