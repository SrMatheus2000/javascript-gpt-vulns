"CWEs": ["CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
"vulnerabilities": ["SQL Injection", "No Input Validation"],
"description": "The function 'unique_name_667' is vulnerable to SQL Injection because it directly uses the 'padId' in a database query without any validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially manipulate the 'padId' to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Additionally, there is no input validation for 'padId', which could lead to other types of attacks."
