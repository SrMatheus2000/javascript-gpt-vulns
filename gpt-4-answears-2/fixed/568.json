"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Insufficient Entropy"],
"description": "The function uses crypto.randomBytes(1)[0] to generate a random number, but it only generates a byte of data. This means the entropy is limited to 256 possible values, which is insufficient for many cryptographic operations. This could lead to predictability in the output, making it easier for an attacker to guess the random number."
