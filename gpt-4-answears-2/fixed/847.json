"description": "The function seems to have a potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability. In the nested for loop towards the end of the function, if the length of 'N' and 'post' arrays are large, it could lead to a large number of iterations causing high CPU usage and potentially leading to a DoS condition. This is known as CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')."
