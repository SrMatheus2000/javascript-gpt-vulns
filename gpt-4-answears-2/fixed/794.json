"vulnerabilities": ["Buffer Overflow"],
"description": "The function uses Buffer.allocUnsafe() to allocate buffer memory. This method of buffer allocation can lead to vulnerabilities as it allows for the creation of a Buffer instance with uninitialized memory. This uninitialized memory may contain sensitive information. It's recommended to use Buffer.alloc() instead, which will initialize the memory with zeros."
