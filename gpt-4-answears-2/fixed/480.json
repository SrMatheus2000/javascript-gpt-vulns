"vulnerabilities": ["Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
"description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the 'linkStr' input before assigning it to 'vertices[id].link'. This could potentially lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if 'linkStr' contains malicious scripts. Also, the function does not escape or encode the 'linkStr' output when the security level is not strict, which could lead to the injection of malicious code."
