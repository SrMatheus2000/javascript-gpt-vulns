"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Prototype Pollution", "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution as it allows the modification of the prototype of a base object. This can lead to the addition of arbitrary properties to base objects, potentially leading to Denial of Service (DoS) or Remote Code Execution (RCE). Additionally, the function does not properly encode or escape output, making it susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. An attacker could inject malicious scripts that would be executed when the output is rendered in a web page."
