"isVulnerable": true,

"vulnerabilities": ["Type coercion", "Potential null pointer dereference"],
"description": "The function does not validate the input 'postObj' before using it, which can lead to type coercion vulnerabilities. For example, the function uses 'parseInt' on 'postObj.deleted' and 'postObj.uid', which can lead to unexpected behavior if these properties are not numbers or strings that can be parsed into numbers. Additionally, the function does not check if 'results.userData[postObj.uid]' or 'results.editors[postObj.editor]' are null before using them, which can lead to null pointer dereference errors."
