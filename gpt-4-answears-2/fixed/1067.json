"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Prototype Pollution"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to prototype pollution as it directly assigns properties from the options object to the _self.config object without any validation. An attacker can manipulate the options object to add or modify properties of the Object prototype. This can lead to a variety of security issues, such as denial of service, alteration of program behavior, or arbitrary code execution."
