"CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Denial of Service (DoS)", "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"],
"description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the input 'Item.note' before processing it. This could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if an attacker provides a large input string, causing the function to consume excessive system resources. Additionally, the function uses regular expressions (RegExp) in a way that can lead to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) if an attacker provides a carefully crafted input string that results in excessive backtracking."
