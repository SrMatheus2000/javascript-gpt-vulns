"description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the 'result' and 'headers' inputs, which can lead to various vulnerabilities. For instance, an attacker can pass malicious input to 'result' that can lead to injection attacks (CWE-74, CWE-89, CWE-94). Also, the function does not handle exceptions that can occur when parsing the 'result' input as JSON or form-encoded data, which can lead to denial of service (CWE-400). Furthermore, the function does not check if the 'content-type' in 'headers' is a valid MIME type (CWE-20)."
