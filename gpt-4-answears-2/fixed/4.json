"description": "The function 'unique_name_1' is vulnerable to code injection attacks. The 'name' parameter is directly passed to 'JSON.stringify' without any form of sanitization or encoding. An attacker could potentially pass malicious code as the 'name' parameter, which would then be executed when the resulting string is used."
