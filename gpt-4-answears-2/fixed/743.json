{
"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-200: Information Exposure", "CWE-310: Cryptographic Issues"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Timing Attack"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to timing attacks as it uses the timingSafeEqual function from the crypto module. This function can leak timing information, making it possible for an attacker to guess the values of a and b by measuring the time it takes for the function to execute."
