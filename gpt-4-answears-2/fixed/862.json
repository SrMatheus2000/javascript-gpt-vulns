"description": "The function 'runNpmCommand' is vulnerable to OS command injection as it uses 'child_process' to execute npm commands. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands. The function 'toggleInstall' and 'upgrade' are vulnerable to code injection as they do not validate the 'id' and 'version' parameters before using them. The function 'Plugins.toggleInstall' and 'Plugins.upgrade' are vulnerable to improper input validation as they do not validate the 'id' and 'version' parameters before using them."
