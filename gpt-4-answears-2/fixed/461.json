"description": "The function seems to be vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) as it does not implement any CSRF tokens in its AJAX requests. This could allow an attacker to trick a victim into executing unwanted actions on a web application in which they're authenticated. Additionally, the function does not appear to validate or sanitize input data before processing, making it susceptible to attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or SQL Injection."
