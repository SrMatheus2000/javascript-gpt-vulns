"description": "The function does not validate the URI input properly, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. It also exposes potentially sensitive information through debug logs. Additionally, the function does not control the consumption of resources, which could lead to a denial of service if an attacker provides a large amount of data."
