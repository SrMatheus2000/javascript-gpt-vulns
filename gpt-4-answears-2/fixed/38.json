"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it reads files from the local filesystem without validating or sanitizing the input, potentially allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files. It also exposes sensitive information (CWE-200) by throwing detailed error messages that could provide an attacker with useful information about the system. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) as it does not limit the amount of data that can be read from a file, potentially leading to a denial of service if an excessively large file is read."
