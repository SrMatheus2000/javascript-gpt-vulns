"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The sanitize function attempts to remove script tags and attributes starting with 'on' or 'javascript', but it does not cover all possible XSS attack vectors. For example, it does not handle event handlers that are not starting with 'on', href attributes with 'javascript:', or script tags embedded in HTML comments. Moreover, the function does not handle case sensitivity, so an attacker could bypass the filter by using uppercase letters. Also, the function does not handle encoded or escaped characters."
