"isVulnerable": true,

"vulnerabilities": ["Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function uses string concatenation to create HTML content, which is then inserted into the DOM using jQuery's $() function. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, which can lead to various security issues such as stealing sensitive information, performing actions on behalf of the user, or spreading malware. The vulnerability is particularly present in the settings.title and settings.content parameters, which are directly inserted into the HTML content."
