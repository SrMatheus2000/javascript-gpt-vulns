"description": "The function 'execCommit' is vulnerable to code injection attacks. The function does not properly sanitize the 'args' input, which is used to construct a command that is executed by the 'runExecFile' function. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code through the 'args' input, leading to arbitrary code execution. Additionally, the function does not validate the 'args' input, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input is not in the expected format or type."
