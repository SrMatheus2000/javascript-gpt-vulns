"description": "The function is vulnerable to path traversal attacks (CWE-22) because it uses user input to construct a file path without properly validating or sanitizing the input. This could allow an attacker to access sensitive files outside of the intended directory. The function also does not properly handle errors (CWE-209), potentially exposing sensitive information in error messages. Additionally, the function does not properly release resources (CWE-404), which could lead to resource exhaustion. Finally, the function could be vulnerable to a denial of service attack (CWE-400) if an attacker sends a large number of requests, as it does not limit the number of concurrent requests."
