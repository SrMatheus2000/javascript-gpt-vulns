"vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "Improper Input Validation"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) as it does not properly validate the 'x-csrf-token' header in the request. An attacker can exploit this by tricking a victim into making a request that the victim did not intend to make. Additionally, the function does not properly validate the input from the request, which can lead to other types of attacks such as SQL Injection, XSS, etc."
