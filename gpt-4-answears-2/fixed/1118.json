"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The data object properties (legendText, headText, subText, extra) are directly inserted into the HTML content without any sanitization or encoding. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through these properties, which will be executed when the HTML content is rendered in the browser. The escapeJsString function is used to escape the primary_key values, but it's not used for the data object properties."
