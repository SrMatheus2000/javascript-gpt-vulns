"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input in file paths without properly neutralizing special elements. This could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Information Exposure Through an Error Message (CWE-209) as it reveals potentially sensitive information about the server's file system structure in error messages."
