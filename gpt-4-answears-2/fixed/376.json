"vulnerabilities": ["Information Disclosure", "Exposure of Sensitive System Information"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to information disclosure as it prints out sensitive system information such as process id, architecture, platform, path, arguments, environment variables, and other details in case of an error. This information can be exploited by an attacker to gain more knowledge about the system and plan further attacks. Additionally, the function also exposes error details which can provide insights into the internal workings of the application, potentially leading to further vulnerabilities being exploited."
