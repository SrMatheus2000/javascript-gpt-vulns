"description": "The function isExternal is vulnerable as it does not properly validate the input URL. This could lead to URL redirection to untrusted sites, which is a common phishing technique. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the match array is null, which could lead to a TypeError if the input URL is not a string or does not match the regular expression."
