"description": "The function uses a hard-coded token to authenticate with Github, which is a security risk. If the token is compromised, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the Github repository. Additionally, the function does not sanitize the 'repo.branch' input before using it in a SQL command, which could lead to SQL injection if the input contains malicious SQL code."
