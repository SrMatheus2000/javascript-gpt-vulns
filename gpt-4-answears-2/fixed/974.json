"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct file paths without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete files outside of the intended directory. It is also vulnerable to Code Injection (CWE-94) as it uses user input in a command that is executed by the system. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. Lastly, it is vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) as it does not limit the number of redirects when downloading a file, which could lead to resource exhaustion."
