"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Potential null pointer dereference", "Lack of input validation"],
"description": "The function does not validate the input 'address' before using it. If a null or undefined value is passed, the function will throw an error when trying to execute the 'trimLeft' method or 'protocolre.exec' method. This can lead to unexpected behavior or application crashes. Additionally, the function does not validate the format of the 'address' input, which could lead to incorrect results or further errors if an invalid format is used."
