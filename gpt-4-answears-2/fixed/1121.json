"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it directly injects user-controlled data into the HTML document without proper sanitization or output encoding, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser. This is identified as CWE-79. Also, the function does not validate or sanitize the input received from the user before using it in the 'post' request, which can lead to various attacks such as SQL Injection, leading to CWE-20."
