"vulnerabilities": ["Information Exposure Through Sent Data", "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "Improper Input Validation"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Information Exposure through Sent Data because it includes sensitive data in HTTP responses that are not protected by encryption. It is also vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) because it does not implement any CSRF protection mechanism. Furthermore, the function does not properly validate or sanitize the user-supplied input, making it susceptible to attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or SQL Injection."
