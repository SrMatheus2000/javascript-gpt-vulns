"description": "The function uses SHA-1, which is a weak hashing algorithm that can be easily cracked. It also does not use a salt in the hashing process, which makes it vulnerable to rainbow table attacks. The function also lacks sufficient computational effort, making it easier for an attacker to crack the password hash."
