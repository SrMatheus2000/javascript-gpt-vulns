"description": "The function evaluate_value uses the Function constructor to evaluate a string as code, which can lead to code injection if the input is not properly sanitized. This is a potential security risk. Additionally, the function parse_problem uses regular expressions in a way that can lead to catastrophic backtracking, causing a denial of service if the input is not properly sanitized."
