"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index", "CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Buffer Overflow", "Type Confusion"],
"description": "The function does not validate that the lengths of 'a' and 'b' are equal before performing the XOR operation. If 'b' is shorter than 'a', this will result in accessing out-of-bounds indices of 'b', leading to a Buffer Overflow vulnerability. Additionally, the function does not validate the input types of 'a' and 'b', which could lead to Type Confusion if non-binary strings are passed as arguments."
