"description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the 'name' and 'config' inputs. This could lead to various types of attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, and Command Injection if the inputs contain malicious strings. The 'name' input is directly used in the 'url.resolve' function which can lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if the 'name' input is a malicious URL. The 'config' input is directly used to get registry and credentials which can lead to Information Exposure if the 'config' input is manipulated to retrieve sensitive information."
