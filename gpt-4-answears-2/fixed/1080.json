"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function uses the .html() and .text() methods to insert user-controlled input into the DOM. If an attacker can control the input, they can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the webpage, which will be executed when the page is loaded. This can lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user."
