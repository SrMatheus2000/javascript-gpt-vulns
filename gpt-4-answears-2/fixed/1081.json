"description": "The function appears to be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the use of the .html(), .append(), and .text() methods, which can potentially insert malicious scripts into the DOM if the input is not properly sanitized. This can lead to various security issues, such as stealing user data or performing actions on behalf of the user."
