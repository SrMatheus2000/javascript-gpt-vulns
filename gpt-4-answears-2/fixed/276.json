{
"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy", "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Timing Attack", "Insufficient Randomness"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to timing attacks as it uses a dummy calculation to mitigate timing attacks, but the timing discrepancy can still be observed. Also, the function uses BigInteger for multiplication which may not generate sufficiently random values, leading to potential predictability in cryptographic operations."
