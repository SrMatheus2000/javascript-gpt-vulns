"vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "Information Exposure", "Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) as it does not implement any CSRF protection mechanism. It also exposes sensitive information by setting cookies without the 'Secure' attribute, which can lead to information exposure if the application is accessed over an insecure connection. Additionally, the function does not validate or sanitize the 'username' input from postData, which can lead to privilege escalation if a malicious user manipulates the 'username' field."
