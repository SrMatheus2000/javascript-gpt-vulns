"description": "The function uses the 'alg' parameter to determine the cryptographic algorithm to use, which can be manipulated by an attacker to use a weak or broken algorithm. This is a vulnerability known as CWE-327. Additionally, the function does not properly validate the 'allowed_algs' parameter, which can lead to unexpected behavior if it is not an array or does not contain the expected values. This is a vulnerability known as CWE-20."
