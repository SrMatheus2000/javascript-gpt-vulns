"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-78", "CWE-20"],
"vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection", "Improper Input Validation"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection because it uses user-supplied input directly in a command that is executed by the operating system. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. The function also lacks proper input validation, as it does not check if the port number is within the valid range of 0-65535."
