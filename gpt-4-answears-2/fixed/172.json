"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The 'slot' variable is directly inserted into the template of 'CustomSlot' without any sanitization or escaping. This means that if a user can control the 'message' parameter of the 'params' object, they can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code, which will be executed when the component is rendered."
