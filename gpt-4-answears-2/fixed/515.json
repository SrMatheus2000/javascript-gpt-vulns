"description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection because it concatenates a user-controlled variable 'this.processName' directly into the API route. An attacker could manipulate 'this.processName' to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Also, the function does not properly validate the 'limit' parameter in the GET request, which could lead to unexpected behavior."
