"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-78", "CWE-88", "CWE-20"],
"vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection", "Argument Injection", "Improper Input Validation"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection because it concatenates user-controlled input into command line instructions that are executed by the system. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. The function also does not properly validate or sanitize the input, which could lead to argument injection or other types of attacks."
