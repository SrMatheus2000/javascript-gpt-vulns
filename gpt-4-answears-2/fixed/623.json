"description": "The function does not validate or sanitize the input that is used to set the contentType, charset, and other properties. This could lead to various issues such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the input is rendered in a web page, or code injection if the input is used in a dangerous function. It's recommended to always validate and sanitize user inputs."
