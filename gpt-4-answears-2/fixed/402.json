"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) as it does not implement any CSRF protection mechanism. This could allow an attacker to trick a victim into making an unintended request to the web application. The function also does not validate or sanitize the 'origin' header of the request, which could lead to security issues if the 'origin' header is controlled by an attacker."
