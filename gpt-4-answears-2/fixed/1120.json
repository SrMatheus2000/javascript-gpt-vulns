"vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it directly injects user-controlled data into HTML without proper sanitization or output encoding, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser. It is also vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) because it does not implement any anti-CSRF mechanism, allowing attackers to trick users into performing actions without their consent."
