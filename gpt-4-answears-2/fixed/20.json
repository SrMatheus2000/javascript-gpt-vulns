"description": "The function is vulnerable to code injection. It dynamically generates code using the 'new Function' constructor, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if user-supplied input is not properly sanitized. This is especially dangerous if the function is used in a server-side JavaScript environment, where an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the server process."
