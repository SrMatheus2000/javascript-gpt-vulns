"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. If the DOMPurify library is not loaded or fails for some reason, the function will directly insert the 'val' parameter into the innerHTML of an element. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the webpage if they can control the 'val' parameter."
