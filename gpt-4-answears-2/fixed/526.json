"vulnerabilities": ["Insecure Cryptographic Algorithm Usage", "Potential Server-Side Request Forgery"],
"description": "The function uses RSA for encryption which is considered a risky cryptographic algorithm due to its susceptibility to various attacks. Also, the function does not validate the 'options' parameter which could lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if an attacker can control the 'options' parameter."
