"vulnerabilities": ["HTTP Header Injection", "HTTP Response Splitting"],
"description": "The function does not properly validate the 'url' input, which can lead to HTTP Header Injection or HTTP Response Splitting if the 'url' contains CRLF sequences. This can allow an attacker to manipulate HTTP responses, leading to potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, cookie manipulation, or other malicious activities."
