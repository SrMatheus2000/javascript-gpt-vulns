"description": "The function is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The 'maxFileSize' and 'maxFiles' parameters are set to 'Infinity' by default, which means an attacker can upload an unlimited number of files of unlimited size, potentially exhausting system resources and causing a service outage. This is a form of Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, also known as Resource Exhaustion (CWE-400)."
