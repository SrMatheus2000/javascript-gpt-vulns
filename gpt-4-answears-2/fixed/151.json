"CWEs": ["CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)", "CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Prototype Pollution", "Unsanitized Input"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution which can lead to multiple potential security vulnerabilities, such as Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, or even Cross-Site Scripting. This happens because the function does not properly prevent the modification of the Object prototype. Additionally, the function does not sanitize or validate the input, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues."
