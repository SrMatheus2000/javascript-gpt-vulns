"description": "The function does not properly check for unusual or exceptional conditions that might lead to unexpected results. For example, it does not check if the input parameters are null or undefined before using them, which could lead to a NULL Pointer Dereference. Also, the function does not handle exceptions that might be thrown by the 'yy' object's methods, which could lead to unexpected application behavior or even application crash."
