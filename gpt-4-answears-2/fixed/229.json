"description": "The function is vulnerable to command injection because it uses user-supplied input in a command that is executed by a child process. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. The function is also vulnerable to path traversal because it uses user-supplied input to construct a file path without properly sanitizing the input. This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete files outside of the intended directory. Additionally, the function creates a temporary file in a publicly accessible directory, which could expose sensitive information or be manipulated by other processes."
