"description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection (CWE-89) as it does not sanitize the 'socketReq.url' before using it in 'Router.fetchRoute'. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. It is also vulnerable to Improper Input Validation (CWE-20) as it does not validate the 'socketReq' before parsing it as JSON. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Lastly, it is vulnerable to Code Injection (CWE-94) as it does not sanitize the 'entityAction' before using it in 'Router.handleRequest'. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code."
