"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input to construct a file path without proper validation. It is also vulnerable to External Control of File Name or Path (CWE-73) as it allows the user to control the file name and path of the downloaded file. Additionally, it is vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) as it does not limit the size of the file being downloaded, which could lead to a denial of service."
