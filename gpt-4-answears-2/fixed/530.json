"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-78", "CWE-522"],
"vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection", "Insufficiently Protected Credentials"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection because it uses user-supplied input in the 'openssl.execBinary' function without proper sanitization or validation. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. Additionally, the function is also vulnerable to insufficiently protected credentials because it stores passwords in a temporary file, which could be accessed by an unauthorized user."
