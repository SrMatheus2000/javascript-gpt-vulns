"description": "The function 'unique_name_261' is vulnerable to path traversal attacks. The variable 'srcpath' is created by joining the current working directory (cwd) with the 'header.linkname' which is not sanitized before use. This could allow an attacker to traverse the file system and access or modify files outside of the intended directory."
