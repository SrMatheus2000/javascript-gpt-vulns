"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input to construct a file path without properly validating or sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to access, read, or execute files outside of the intended directory. It's also vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79) as it does not sanitize the user-supplied input before using it, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts. Lastly, it's vulnerable to Improper Input Validation (CWE-20) as it does not properly validate or sanitize the user-supplied input before using it."
