{"isVulnerable": true, "CWEs": ["CWE-95", "CWE-94"], "vulnerabilities": ["Code Injection", "Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code"], "description": "The function uses the eval() function, which can lead to code injection if user-controlled data is passed to it. This can lead to arbitrary code execution. The function also does not properly neutralize directives in dynamically evaluated code, which can lead to code injection vulnerabilities."}
