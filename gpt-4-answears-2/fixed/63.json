"vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection"],
"description": "The function inetLatency is vulnerable to OS command injection because it concatenates the user-supplied 'host' input directly into the command that is executed by the 'exec' function. An attacker could exploit this by providing a malicious 'host' value that includes shell metacharacters, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the system."
