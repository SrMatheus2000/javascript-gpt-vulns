"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-471", "CWE-20"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)", "Improper Input Validation"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID) as it directly modifies the target object without checking if it's immutable or not. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the target object is assumed to be immutable elsewhere in the code. Additionally, the function does not validate the input objects in the rest parameter, which can lead to improper input validation vulnerability if malicious objects are passed."
