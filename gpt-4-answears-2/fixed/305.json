"description": "The function does not validate the input for 'header' and 'length' which can lead to unexpected behavior (CWE-20). Also, the function uses a regular expression to parse the 'header' input which can lead to Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) if the input is not properly sanitized (CWE-400)."
