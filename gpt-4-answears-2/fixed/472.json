"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to access file system without proper validation. SQL Injection (CWE-89) and Code Injection (CWE-94) vulnerabilities exist as the function uses user input in SQL queries and code execution without proper sanitization. The function is also vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) as it does not limit the number of resources that can be used, potentially leading to Denial of Service."
