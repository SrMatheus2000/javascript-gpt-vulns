"vulnerabilities": ["SQL Injection", "Denial of Service"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection because it concatenates the 'padId' directly into the SQL query without any sanitization or parameterization, which allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks because it does not limit the number of records it processes, which could lead to resource exhaustion if an attacker provides a large number of records."
