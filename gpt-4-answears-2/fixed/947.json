"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-89"],
"vulnerabilities": ["SQL Injection"],
"description": "The function takes a SQL query as a parameter and directly executes it without any sanitization or parameterization, which makes it vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks. An attacker could provide a malicious SQL query that could read sensitive data, modify database data, potentially execute system commands, or exploit other vulnerabilities in the database."
