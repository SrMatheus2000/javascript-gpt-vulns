"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input in file paths without properly sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to access, read, or modify files outside of the intended directory. The function is also vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79) as it does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before inserting it into HTML output. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users."
