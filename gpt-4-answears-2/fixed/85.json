{
"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-78", "CWE-20"],
"vulnerabilities": ["OS Command Injection", "Improper Input Validation"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to OS command injection because it uses user-supplied input (the 'ip' variable) directly in a command that is executed by the operating system. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. Additionally, the function does not properly validate the 'ip' input, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors."
