"CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Denial of Service (DoS)", "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"],
"description": "The function does not validate the input 'userAgent' before using it in the function. This could lead to unexpected behavior or even a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if a malicious user provides a specially crafted 'userAgent' string. The function also does not control the consumption of resources which could lead to a resource exhaustion scenario, causing the application to slow down or crash."
