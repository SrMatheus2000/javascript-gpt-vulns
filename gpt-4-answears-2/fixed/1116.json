"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to access files (fs.statSync(staticPath)). An attacker could manipulate the input to access sensitive files outside of the intended directory. It is also vulnerable to Code Injection (CWE-94) as it uses user input to construct code that is then executed (controllerInst[params.action]). An attacker could manipulate the input to execute arbitrary code."
