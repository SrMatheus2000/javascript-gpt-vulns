"description": "The function is vulnerable to several types of attacks. It does not validate input properly (CWE-20), which can lead to various types of attacks. It exposes sensitive information (CWE-200) by not encrypting sensitive data (CWE-311) and transmitting sensitive information in cleartext (CWE-319). It also does not control resource consumption (CWE-400), which can lead to a denial of service."
