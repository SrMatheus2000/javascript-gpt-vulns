"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-89", "CWE-20"],
"vulnerabilities": ["SQL Injection", "Improper Input Validation"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to SQL Injection because it concatenates a variable (this.processName) directly into the API route without proper sanitization or parameterization. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the SQL query. Additionally, the function does not properly validate the 'limit' parameter from the request query, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors."
