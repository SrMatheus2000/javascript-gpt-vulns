"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-79", "CWE-352", "CWE-20"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "Improper Input Validation"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) as it uses user input in the 'state' parameter directly without proper sanitization or encoding, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts. It is also vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) as it does not implement any anti-CSRF tokens or similar mechanisms, allowing an attacker to trick a victim into executing unwanted actions. Furthermore, the function does not validate or sanitize user input properly, leading to potential security risks."
