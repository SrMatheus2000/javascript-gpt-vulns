"description": "The function uses a cryptographic algorithm that may not be secure. The function also uses a potentially predictable random value, which can lead to vulnerabilities if an attacker can guess the value. Additionally, the function does not limit the amount of resources it consumes, which can lead to a denial of service if an attacker can cause it to consume a large amount of resources."
