"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct a file path without proper sanitization or validation. This could allow an attacker to access arbitrary files on the system. The function is also vulnerable to Code Injection (CWE-94) as it uses user input in the 'options' object to dynamically construct code without proper sanitization or validation. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code."
