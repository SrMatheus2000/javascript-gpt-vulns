"description": "The function uses the 'escapeHtml' function to sanitize the 'curr_table_name' and 'curr_column_name' variables before they are used in a string that is later added to the DOM. However, it's not clear from the provided code whether 'escapeHtml' properly sanitizes all possible malicious inputs. If it doesn't, this could lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, where an attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web page. This is identified as CWE-79."
