It is primarily concerned with formatting and displaying JSON data in HTML, and it properly escapes any HTML special characters in the JSON keys and values to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. It also does not use any dangerous functions or methods that could lead to security issues, such as eval()."
