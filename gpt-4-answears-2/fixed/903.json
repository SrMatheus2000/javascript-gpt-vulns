"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function 'compileHtml' replaces encoded versions of '<', '>', '&' with their actual characters, which can lead to XSS if the input is not properly sanitized. Additionally, the function 'trySanitize' attempts to sanitize the input but falls back to the old value or an empty string if an error occurs, which can be bypassed by causing an exception during sanitization."
