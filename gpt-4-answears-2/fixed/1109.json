"vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The data.error and data.explain[i] values are directly inserted into the HTML without proper sanitization or escaping. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, which would then be executed in the context of the victim's browser. The function also fails to properly encode or escape output, which could lead to other types of injection attacks."
