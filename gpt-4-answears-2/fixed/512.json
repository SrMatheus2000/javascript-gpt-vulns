"description": "The function is vulnerable to timing attacks. The function uses the length of 'a' to create the buffers for both 'a' and 'b'. If 'a' is shorter than 'b', the function will only compare the first 'aLen' characters of 'b' to 'a', which can lead to false positives. Additionally, the function leaks the length of 'a' and 'b' by comparing their lengths at the end, which can provide an attacker with additional information. This is a violation of CWE-208 (Information Exposure Through Observable Differences) and CWE-203 (Information Exposure Through Discrepancy)."
