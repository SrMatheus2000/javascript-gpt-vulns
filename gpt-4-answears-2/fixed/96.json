"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it reads a file using a path constructed from user input without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server. It is also vulnerable to Code Injection (CWE-94) as it directly uses user input in the 'app.get' and 'app.post' methods without proper validation or sanitization, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious code. Furthermore, the function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CWE-352) as it does not implement any CSRF protection mechanism, potentially allowing an attacker to trick a victim into performing actions on their behalf."
