"isVulnerable": true,

"vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "Improper Input Validation"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it directly uses user input in the creation of a URL without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts. Additionally, the function does not validate the 'path_part' input, which could lead to unexpected behavior or further vulnerabilities."
