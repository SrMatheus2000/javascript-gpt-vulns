"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-347", "CWE-20"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "Improper Input Validation"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to cryptographic issues as it does not properly verify the cryptographic signature. This could allow an attacker to forge a signature and pass it off as legitimate. Additionally, the function does not properly validate its input, which could lead to further vulnerabilities."
