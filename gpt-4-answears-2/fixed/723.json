"description": "The provided JavaScript function does not appear to contain any common security vulnerabilities. It is primarily composed of type checking and utility functions, and does not perform any risky operations such as eval(), does not manipulate the DOM, does not handle user input, and does not make any network requests. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to common web security issues such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), or SQL Injection."
