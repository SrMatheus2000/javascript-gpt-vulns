"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct file paths without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to read or write files outside of the intended directory. It is also vulnerable to Code Injection (CWE-94) as it uses the 'exec' function from 'child_process' module which can execute arbitrary commands if user input is not properly sanitized. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) as it does not limit the number of event emitters that can be created, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack."
