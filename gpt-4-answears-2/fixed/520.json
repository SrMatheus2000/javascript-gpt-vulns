"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user-supplied input to construct a filesystem path without properly validating or sanitizing the input. This could allow an attacker to access or modify files outside of the intended directory. It is also vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79) as it does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before returning it in the HTTP response. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are executed by the victim's browser. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CWE-352) as it does not implement any CSRF protection mechanisms, allowing an attacker to trick a victim into making an unintended request to the web application."
