"vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The href, title, and text parameters are directly concatenated into the output string without any proper sanitization or encoding. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through these parameters, which will be executed when the output string is rendered in a browser. This is a violation of CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'). Additionally, the function violates CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output, as it fails to properly encode or escape the output data."
