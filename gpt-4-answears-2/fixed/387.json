"description": "The function appears to be safe. It iterates over the 'encodings' object and escapes any HTML in the values using a utility function. This should prevent any Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function then constructs an HTML table as a string, which is returned. There doesn't appear to be any vulnerabilities in this function, assuming that the Utils.escapeHtml and Utils.printable functions are implemented correctly."
