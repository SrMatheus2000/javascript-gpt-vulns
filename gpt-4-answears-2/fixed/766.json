"isVulnerable": true,

"vulnerabilities": ["Unrestricted use of dangerous function"],
"description": "The function uses the Function constructor in an unrestricted way, which can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if user-controlled input is passed into the function. The Function constructor is a form of eval() which can execute arbitrary JavaScript code and potentially lead to code injection attacks."
