"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) as it uses user input to construct file paths without proper validation or sanitization. It is also vulnerable to OS Command Injection (CWE-78) as it uses user input to construct shell commands without proper validation or sanitization. Code Injection (CWE-94) is possible as the function uses user input to construct code without proper validation or sanitization. The function also exposes sensitive information through error messages (CWE-209), which could provide an attacker with valuable information about the system."
