"description": "The function is vulnerable to Path Traversal and SQL Injection attacks. The function uses user input to construct a file path without properly sanitizing the input, which can allow an attacker to access arbitrary files on the system (CWE-22). Additionally, if the URL parameter contains SQL commands, they could be executed on the server side, leading to SQL Injection (CWE-89)."
