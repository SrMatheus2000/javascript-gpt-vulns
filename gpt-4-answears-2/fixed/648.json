"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it uses the 'rendy' function to directly insert user-controlled input into HTML output. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, leading to various attacks such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user. This is related to CWE-79. Additionally, the function does not validate or sanitize the 'params' input, which can lead to unexpected behavior or further vulnerabilities. This is related to CWE-20."
