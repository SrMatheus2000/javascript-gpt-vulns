"description": "The function is vulnerable to path traversal attacks (CWE-22) because it constructs a file path with user-supplied input (ReceivedPath). An attacker can manipulate the ReceivedPath to access arbitrary files on the system. The function also fails to properly validate or sanitize the ReceivedPath (CWE-20), which can lead to other types of attacks such as null byte injection."
