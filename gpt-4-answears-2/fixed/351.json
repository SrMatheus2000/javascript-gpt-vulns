"description": "The function is vulnerable to information exposure through error messages (CWE-209) as it sends detailed error messages to the client. This could potentially reveal sensitive information to an attacker. It also exposes information through its GET request method with sensitive query strings (CWE-598), which could be logged in various places, exposing sensitive information. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to general information exposure (CWE-200) as it reveals system-level details to the client."
