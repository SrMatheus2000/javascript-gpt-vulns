"description": "The function sync is vulnerable to OS command injection. It takes an 'os' object as input and directly uses the 'file' and 'args' properties of the 'command' function's return value to execute a command. If an attacker can control the 'file' or 'args' values, they can execute arbitrary commands on the system."
