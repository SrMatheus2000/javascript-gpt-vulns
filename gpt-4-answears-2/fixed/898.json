"description": "The function validateLink is vulnerable as it only checks for the presence of bad protocols at the start of the URL. An attacker can bypass this check by appending a good protocol at the start. Also, the function does not validate or sanitize the input properly which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or URL Redirection attacks. Furthermore, the function does not encode or escape the output properly, which can lead to injection attacks."
