"CWEs": ["CWE-20: Improper Input Validation", "CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"],
"vulnerabilities": ["No validation of 'data' input", "Potential SQL Injection through 'adapterSessionIds'"],
"description": "The function does not validate the 'data' input which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Additionally, the 'adapterSessionIds' from the payload are used directly in the 'unstoreGrant' function which could lead to SQL Injection if the function interacts with a database and does not properly sanitize the input."
