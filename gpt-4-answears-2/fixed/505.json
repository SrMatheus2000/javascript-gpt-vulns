"description": "The function loadImage is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks because it does not properly sanitize the 'image' input when it is a string. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page. Additionally, the function does not validate the 'image' input when it is a File or Blob, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors."
