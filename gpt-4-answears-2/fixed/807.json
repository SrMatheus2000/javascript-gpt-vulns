"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The function uses the jQuery html() method to set the innerHTML of an element. This method does not escape or sanitize the input, so if the input includes script tags, those scripts will be executed when the HTML is added to the page. This can lead to various types of attacks, such as stealing user data or performing actions on behalf of the user."
