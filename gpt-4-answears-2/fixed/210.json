"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-79"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"],
"description": "The function is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because it directly uses user input to create elements in the DOM without properly sanitizing the input. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through the 'items' parameter, which could lead to unauthorized access or other malicious activities."
