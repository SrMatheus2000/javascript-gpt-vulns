"isVulnerable": true,
"CWEs": ["CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function"],
"vulnerabilities": ["Insecure use of 'new Buffer()'"],
"description": "The function uses 'new Buffer()', which is a potentially dangerous function as it can lead to security issues if not used properly. If the input is controlled by an attacker, it can lead to problems like buffer overflow. It's recommended to use 'Buffer.from()', 'Buffer.alloc()', or 'Buffer.allocUnsafe()' instead."
