"description": "The provided JavaScript function does not appear to contain any common security vulnerabilities. It is primarily defining regular expressions and does not perform any risky operations such as eval(), does not manipulate the DOM, does not make any AJAX calls, and does not handle any user input directly. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to common web application vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), or SQL Injection."
